I was in that same situation, screaming out in pain every time I went to the bathroom.

I couldn't concentrate, or do my job or have a normal conversation with my wife.

IT'S THIS BITTER TASTE THAT MAKES IT THE PERFECT INGREDIENT FOR THE FAMOUS SUNDAKKAI VATHA KUZHAMBU OR KARA KUZHAMBU. IN TAMIL , THIS BERRY IS NOT AVAILABLE AROUND THE YEAR. ONE REASON WHY IT'S COMMON FOR SUNDAKKAI TO BE SUNDRIED AND DEEP FRIED AS CRISPIES (LIKE THE BITTER GOURD CRISPIES) THAT CAN BE TO GRAVIES AND MORE KUZHAMBU (CRAFTED WITH TEMPERED BUTTER MILK). ASIDE FROM THE THAI GREEN CURRY, THE PEA AUBERGINE IS ALSO (UNCOOKED) TO THAI CHILLI PASTES. THE PEA AUBERGINE IS BELIEVED TO BE A NATIVE PLANT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION. IT IS USED IN JAMAICAN CUISINE AND RUMOURED TO BE USED IN HAITIAN VOODOO RITUALS. YOU DON'T NEED TO VOODOO TO EXTRACT THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF THIS BERRY THOUGH (OUR RECIPES SHOULD DO!). THE PEA AUBERGINE IS RICH IN NUTRIENTS AND IS A GOOD SOURCE OF CALCIUM AND IRON. IT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR A VARIETY OF AILMENTS FROM STOMACH DISORDERS TO DIABETES. I REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER SUNDAKKAI POWDER TO HER 'GO TO' HERBAL MIX - ANGAYA PODI (IT ALSO FEATURES D
 RIED NEEM FLOWERS) THAT WORKS WONDERS FOR DIGESTIVE DISORDERS AND IS GOOD FOR NEW MOTHERS. JUST LIKE BITTER GOURD, THE PEA AUBERGINE IS AN ACQUIRED TASTE. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING I ENJOYED EATING AS A KID BUT I'VE GROWN TO ENJOY A FLAVOURFUL SUNDAKKAI VATHA KUZHAMBU. THIS IS MY MOTHER'S FAIL-PROOF RECIPE: HIGH CHOLESTEROL IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR HEART DISEASE. WHILE LOOKING FOR RISK FACTORS YOUR DOCTOR TESTING FOR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS (LDL), AND HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. HIGH LEVELS OF TOTAL AND LDL CHOLESTEROL INCREASE YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASES WHILE HIGH LEVELS OF HDL CHOLESTEROL ARE A PROTECTIVE FACTOR. YOUR DAILY DIET PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING YOUR HEALTH GOALS. HIGH CHOLESTEROL CAN BE PREVENTED AND EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY A COMBINATION OF A GOOD DIET, REGULAR EXERCISE, IDEAL BODY WEIGHT AND AN OVERALL HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. IN TO THIS, SOME COMMONLY USED KITCHEN INGREDIENTS CAN HELP IN CON
 TROLLING HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. COMMONLY USED IN INDIAN COOKING, GARLIC HAS BEEN FOR ITS HEALTH ENHANCING PROPERTIES . GARLIC IS UP OF AMINO ACIDS, VITAMINS, MINERALS, AND ORGANOSULFUR COMPOUNDS SUCH AS ALLICIN, AJOENE, S-ALLYLCYSTEINE, S-ETHYLCYSTEINE, AND DIALLYLSULFIDE. THESE SULPHUR COMPOUNDS ARE SAID TO BE THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS THAT LEND THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES TO GARLIC.
