			<p style="line-height:1.4;">Hey,</p>

			<p style="line-height:1.4;">What if you could manifest what you want?<br />
			Your life would be so much easier and better, right?</p>

			<p style="line-height:1.4;">The Law of Attraction works best when you align the 3 levels of your mind. But most don&#39;t know about the 3rd level, the &quot;vibrational mind&quot; and that is why some people cannot get manifest the things they want. They are missing one of the most important parts of the law of attraction.</p>
