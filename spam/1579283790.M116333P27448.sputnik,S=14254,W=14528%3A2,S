The Crazy Reason Why This "Tesla Lighter"
Is Making Other Fire Starters Obsolete
This is definitely one of the coolest survival tools ever, seriously!

Cool meaning it's so awesome your friends might accidentally "lose it" in their pockets forever.

So honestly, be careful who you let use it.



You can see it here.

Not only is the plasma arc survival tool the definition of cool, it's also a huge improvement on a crucial survival tool most experts place in their top 5 most important tools.


Here are a few reasons you're going to have a tough time not falling in love with it:

Shoots Advanced Plasma Arcs: Famed inventor Nikola Tesla came up with technology for this design. We just figured out how to fit it in a tiny survival tool.

Completely Windproof and Water-Resistant: Drop it in a lake, use it in a tornado and it's going to work without issues. This makes it perfect for survival!

Compact and Lightweight: Smaller than a box of matches, lighter than a handful of pennies, it'll never weigh you down and will fit in the smallest of spaces.

Super Long-Lasting: You can use this tool an hour a day, everyday for 100 years and it'll still go even longer! Go here and you'll see why that's going to save you a lot of $$$.

Best of all?

Right now you can get this crazy-cool survival tool for a great price as part of a special promotion.

This promo price (50% off) won't last long and you won't find this deal anywhere else.

Go here to see our new tool and to get it at this great price.

Purnell

ighter that makes it superior to other fire starters?

It's incredibly easy to use.

Because it doesn't produce a lick of flame you don't have to deal with pesky childproofing elements so many other lighter have.

Plus this lighter lights flawlessly each and every single time you press it's oversized button. Try getting that with matches or strike style fire starters that can take forever to light.

These features alone make it perfect for survival situations as well as general, everyday use.

And now it's time the best part about this lighter is revealed...
