			It&#39;s about how scientists are stunned after they finally discovered something way more efficient (for all self-respecting Americans) than solar energy.<br />
			<br />
			They just couldn&#39;t believe their eyes... and it&#39;s right here.<br />
			<br />
			Rumors say that the energy world the way you know it will never be the same again...<br />
			<br />
			and that many scientists preferred to flee than to face this life-changing energy miracle.<br />
			<br />
			Some say it&#39;s from GOD.. others that it has always been there...<br />
			<br />
			and even others that it might be just dust in the wind.<br />

<div style="color:#BFFBB5;font-size:10px;">Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. These included an attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya, and the Battle of Hong Kong. These attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia and several other states to ally declare war on Japan, was the Soviet Union, bein
 g heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, its neutrality agreement with Japan. Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that h been ed by Roosevelt. Axis vance stalls (1942&ndash;43) US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British PM ston Churchill seated at the Casablanca Conference, January 1943 On 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four&mdash;the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom and the United States&mdash;and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, tby affirming the Atlantic Charter, and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers. During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The 
 Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should tar peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leing to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persued the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should inste focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.</div>
