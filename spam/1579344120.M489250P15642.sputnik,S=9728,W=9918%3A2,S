Over the weekend I sent you an email all about how the "healthy"foods you're eating can end up acting like a bee sting in your body. Increasing inflammation and that puffy, swollen look : Well..

About 6,000 people checked it out and we had a bunch of emails from people saying that it was the best analogy the ever heard! After all...

If you think you're eating relatively healthy but you're still bloated and can't seem to lose fat, then this probably has to do with your body being inflamed like it's gotten stung by a bee

It all makes sense in the documentary I sent out this last weekend. Which is why I'm emailing you now...

If you haven't checked it out yet, make sure you do, ok

BUT THE GOLDEN RULE OF GOOD HAIRCARE LIES IN DOING THE SIMPLEST OF THINGS FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME. SOME DAILY HABITS CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE – ONE OF THEM BEING OILING YOUR HAIR REGULARLY. BHRINGRAJ, AS ‘KEHRAJ‘ IN ASSAMESE AND ‘KARISALANKANNI’ IN TAMIL, IS A MEDICINAL HERB THAT GROWS IN MOIST AREAS. ACCORDING TO AYURVEDA, THE LEAF IS CONSIDERED TO BE A POWERFUL LIVER CLEANSER, AND IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR THE HAIR. IT IS REGARDED AS THE ‘RASAYANA’ – AN INGREDIENT THAT REJUVENATES AND SLOWS DOWN THE AGEING PROCESS. YOU CAN BUY BHRINGRAJ OIL AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET WHICH IS OFTEN MIXED WITH OTHER HERBS OR CHOOSE TO MAKE IT AT HOME. TO MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN, SUN DRY GROUND BHRINGRAJ FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS AND THEN IMMERSE THE DRIED ROUNDS IN A JAR OF COCONUT OIL OR SESAME OIL. IT OUT IN THE SUN FOR ANOTHER TWO TO THREE DAYS TILL THE COLOUR OF THE OIL CHANGES TO LIGHT GREEN. A QUICKER WAY OF MAKING BHRINGRAJ OIL AT HOME IS TO HEAT POWDERED BHRINGRAJ WITH COCO
 NUT OIL AND THEN STORE. THE OIL IS DARK GREEN IN COLOUR AND HAS A UNIQUE, STRONG AROMA. THE BEST WAY TO USE IT IS TO APPLY IT DIRECTLY ON THE SCALP, LET THE ROOTS ABSORB IT FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES AND THEN WASH OFF. BHRINGRAJ OIL CAN BE USED FOR TREATING VARIOUS HAIR AND SKIN PROBLEMS. DERMATOLOGIST DR. DEEPALI BHARDWAJ EXPLAINS THAT BHRINGRAJ OIL HAS A HIGH SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHICH MAKES IT DENSE. THIS SIMPLY MEANS THAT IT CAN EASILY PENETRATE THE SCALP AND HELPS IN TREATING DRY SCALP. FOR DRY HAIR, RUB IT ON YOUR SCALP, WRAP A STEAMED TOWEL FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN MASSAGE SOME MORE OIL AGAIN. THIS HELPS IN DEEPER ABSORPTION AND HELPS IN ACTIVATING THE SEBACEOUS GLANDS. USE WARM OIL TO GET RID OF DANDRUFF AND IT ON OVERNIGHT. RUB SOME LIME JUICE ON YOUR SCALP THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE YOU RINSE YOUR HAIR.
