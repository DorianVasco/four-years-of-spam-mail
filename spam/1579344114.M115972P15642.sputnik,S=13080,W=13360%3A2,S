Recognition of eSports competitions outside South Korea has come somewhat slower. Along with South Korea, most competitions take place in Europe, North America and China. Despite its large video game market, eSports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, which has been attributed largely to its broanti-gambling laws.[10]The global eSports market generated US $325 million of revenue in 2015 and is expected to 493 million in 2016; the global eSports audience in 2015 was 226 million Demographi, Major League Gaming has reported viewership that is approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34.[7] Despite this, several female personalities within eSports are hopeful about the increasing presence of female gamers.[8][9] South Korea has several established eSports organizations, which hav
 e licensed pro gamers since the year 2000. Recognition of eSports competitions outside South Korea has come somewhat slower. Along with South Korea, most competitions take place in Europe, North America and China.Measured by scalograms, the data provide comparative indicators of the progress each country has achieved over the period 1974–2000. The study tests this time series for ‘patterns’, guided by the hypothesis that the multiple dimensions of liberalization, transition and consolidation are consistently related to each other, both temporally and spatially. The findings indicate a single underlying dimensional structure to the data. This allows separate scales for liberalization and consolidation to be created and combined into a general indicator of democratization.
