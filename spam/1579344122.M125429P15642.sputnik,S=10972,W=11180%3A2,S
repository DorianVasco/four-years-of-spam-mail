The energy world is on fire after this guy spilled the beans that no one should rely on the greedy energy fat cats anymore

Well, his name is Joe. He lives in New York...and during the hurricane Sandy he discovered something, a crazy source of relentless energy that saved his life.

During all these years he tried to make it public but the guys (you know who) did their best to stop him.

TVs ignored his story... although he was the only one thriving while half of the city died.

Anyway, with a bit of luck he finally managed to reveal his story...and it's all here... for a very limited period of time.

PRE-DIABETES, A PRECURSOR TO FULL-BLOWN DISEASE, BUT DIET SODA IS NOT, A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTS. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE LINK BETWEEN DIET SODAS AND DIABETES HAVE BEEN MIXED; SOME RESEARCH POINTING TO A POTENTIAL CONNECTION HAS SUGGESTED THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY BE EXPLAINED AT LEAST IN PART BY SODA DRINKERS BEING OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, HOWEVER,  WHO ROUTINELY CONSUMED AT LEAST ONE CAN OF SODA OR OTHER SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES A DAY WERE 46 PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ELEVATED BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS THAN PEOPLE WHO RARELY OR DRINK COLA. “EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON SUBSTITUTING SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES WITH WATER, UNSWEETENED TEAS, OR COFFEE,” SAID SENIOR STUDY AUTHOR NICOLA MCKEOWN, A NUTRITION RESEARCHER AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY IN BOSTON. “FOR DAILY CONSUMERS OF SUGARY DRINKS, KICKING THE HABIT MAY BE A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE, AND INCORPORATING AN OCCASIONAL DIET SODA, WHILE INCREASING FLUIDS FROM OTHER SOURCES, MAY BE THE BEST STRATEGY TO ULTIMATELY DIABETES, WHIC
 H HAPPENS WHEN THE BODY CAN'T PROPERLY USE OR MAKE ENOUGH OF THE HORMONE INSULIN TO CONVERT BLOOD SUGAR INTO ENERGY. PEOPLE WITH BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED, BUT NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR A DIABETES DIAGNOSIS, ARE SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS HAVING “PRE-DIABETES” BECAUSE MANY WILL GO ON TO DEVELOP DIABETES. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, RESEARCHERS EXAMINED DATA OVERWEIGHT. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES DETAILING WHAT THEY ATE AND DRANK DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES WERE DEFINED AS COLAS AND OTHER CARBONATED BEVERAGES, AS WELL AS DRINKS SUCH AS  FOR FACTORS SUCH AS AGE, GENDER AND WEIGHT, RESEARCHERS REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF NUTRITION. HIGHER CONSUMPTION OF SODA AND OTHER SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH INSULIN RESISTANCE, A REDUCED ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE HORMONE INSULIN THAT IS ANOTHER RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPING DIABETES. EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN WEIGHT AND OTHER ASPECTS OF DIET, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SUGAR-SWEET
 ENED BEVERAGES AND THESE METABOLIC RISK FACTORS FOR DIABETES PERSISTED. DIET SODA INTAKE—DEFINED AS LOW-CALORIE COLA OR OTHER CARBONATED LOW-CALORIE BEVERAGES— WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED BLOOD SUGAR OR INSULIN RESISTANCE. THE STUDY DOESN’T PROVE SODA OR SUGARY DRINKS CAUSE DIABETES. ANOTHER LIMITATION OF THE STUDY IS THAT PARTICIPANTS MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF A TYPICAL U.S A LARGE BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT THE SUGAR AND CALORIES IN SODA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISK OF OBESITY AND DIABETES, NOTED DR.
