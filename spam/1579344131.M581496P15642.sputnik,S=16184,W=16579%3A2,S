Home-scientist discovers easy way



to restore old batteries

by Jean Erickson@EnergyTechReview

His name is Tom Ericson, a home-scientist who decided it was time to stop wasting old batteries
<http://won.gwaelonna.com/nceicqcu/rwdeqn20514mbmh/bI2wMN75YsWGcjppgCh2zdBzLA3GnPHo_dNnC9NaP_U/4BQq6TfpQIPewjaLZXU-OIuG67r_Qmj2CmkTc1cKyHhpfCw07hGTH4LuCC8phmffWA_Y7HbGUoFg8T6y6WqFUmuNkodw1Rw_lKouWjCCDz-hsAxuGTlBPWl1xJAIhALi>.

""I'm not a rich man, and batteries aren't cheap," said Ericson when he was asked what prompted this "discovery" of his. According to Ericson, few people know how easy it can be to restore old batteries
<http://won.gwaelonna.com/nceicqcu/rwdeqn20514mbmh/bI2wMN75YsWGcjppgCh2zdBzLA3GnPHo_dNnC9NaP_U/4BQq6TfpQIPewjaLZXU-OIuG67r_Qmj2CmkTc1cKyHhpfCw07hGTH4LuCC8phmffWA_Y7HbGUoFg8T6y6WqFUmuNkodw1Rw_lKouWjCCDz-hsAxuGTlBPWl1xJAIhALi> if you have the tools, which can easily be purchased at local hardware stores or at websites like amazon.com and others.

The process involves just a little bit of prep work and then a handful of steps to clean and sometimes recharge the batteries a bit, all of which can easily be done at home at a far lower cost
<http://won.gwaelonna.com/nceicqcu/rwdeqn20514mbmh/bI2wMN75YsWGcjppgCh2zdBzLA3GnPHo_dNnC9NaP_U/4BQq6TfpQIPewjaLZXU-OIuG67r_Qmj2CmkTc1cKyHhpfCw07hGTH4LuCC8phmffWA_Y7HbGUoFg8T6y6WqFUmuNkodw1Rw_lKouWjCCDz-hsAxuGTlBPWl1xJAIhALi> than constantly purchasing new batteries.

Ericson says the only reason most people don't know about this is "because the energy companies and production companies aren't interested in getting the word out."

THE 2016 campaign was a crisis for silva conservatism; its aftermath is a crisis for jerky liberalism.

The left, delivered unexpectedly to jet impotence, has no choice but to start maritime arguing about how it lost its way. unveil A lot of that argument already revolves hao around the concept of identity politics, used mutant as shorthand for a of political slingshot liberalism as a coalition of diverse groups fatal  and black and Asian and today Hispanic and female and Jewish and Muslim yugoslavia and so on bound together by technique a common struggle against the creaking hegemony wrestling of white Christian America. This had sewing an intuitive appeal in the Obama era, arsenic when it won the White House twice ink and seemed to promise permanent political majorities advocate in the future. And the 2016 campaign scripps was
  supposed to cement that promise, since hoist it pitted liberalisms coalition of the diverse pax against Donald Trumps explicitly reactive .
