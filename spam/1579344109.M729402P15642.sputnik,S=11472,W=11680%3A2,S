IN THE FIRST PART HELD OVER FOUR DAYS AGO, THE BJP EMERGED AS A MAJOR GAINER, MAKING SIGNIFICANT IN THE CONGRESS AND NCP'S STRONGHOLDS. ARE 9.2 MILLION VOTERS IN MUMBAI BUT THE CITY HAS NOT FOR A BIG VOTER TURNOUT. IN THE 2014 NATIONAL ELECTION 55% OF THE CITY VOTED, WHILE 54% VOTED IN THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS A FEW MONTHS LATER. IN THE LAST TWO CIVIC ELECTIONS THE VOTER TURNOUT DID NOT EXCEED 46 PER CENT. SHAINA NC OF THE BJP CYCLED TO VOTE AT THE NAPANSEA POLLING BOOTH BUT SAID SHE COULD NOT FIND HER NAME ON THE LIST. PAWAR, CHIEF OF THE NATIONALIST CONGRESS PARTY, VOTED IN MUMBAI'S MAHALAXMI. HE COULD NOT VOTE FOR HIS PARTY AS THE NCP HAS NOT FIELDED A CANDIDATE . THE SENA AND THE BJP COULD NOT AGREE OVER SEAT SHARING TO THE SHIV SENA ANNOUNCING THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IS FINISHED. UDHAV THACKERAY HAS SAID HE WILL BE PULLING OUT OF THE BJP-LED STATE AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS AFTER THE CIVIC POLLS. AS IT HAS LOST GROUND TO THE BJP, THE SHIV SENA HAS BEEN PLAYING PROXY OPPOSITION TO THE BJ
 P. SENA HAVE TAKEN EVERY TO CRITICISE THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENT - FROM ITS HANDLING OF DEMONETISATION TO ITS PAKISTAN POLICY AND HANDLING OF FLOODS AND DROUGHTS IN THE COUNTRY. ARE 227 SEATS IN THE BMC. THE SHIV SENA WON 75 OF THE 227 SEATS LAST TIME, WITH THE BJP 31, THE CONGRESS 52 AND THE NCP 13. VOTES WILL BE COUNTED ON THURSDAY. MUMBAI IS VOTING TODAY TO DECIDE WHICH PARTY WILL CONTROL THE COUNTRY'S RICHEST CIVIC BODY THE BRIHANMUMBAI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OR BMC, IN WHAT IS SEEN AS A SHIV SENA VS BJP CONTEST. OF THE ELECTIONS THE SHIV SENA OFF ITS TWO-OLD ALLIANCE WITH THE BJP AND THE TWO PARTIES HAVE ENGAGED IN A SHRILL, OFTEN PERSONAL, CAMPAIGN. VOTING IS ALSO BEING HELD FOR NINE OTHER MUNICIPALITIES IN MAHARASHTRA TODAY. THE BMC HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF 37,000 CRORES, MORE THAN THAT OF SOME STATES. THIS IS 2017 AND AS PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI'S FOLLOWERS INSIST, WE "LIBERALS" REMAIN STUCK ON HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN 2002 AND NOT HIS DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. ONE CAN AGREE THAT T
 HE ALLEGATIONS HAVE GRAINS OF TRUTH IN IT. BUT EVERY TIME, WE THE LIBERALS TRY TO FOCUS ON THE WORK DONE BY THE NDA GOVERNMENT OR HEAR MODI SPEAK ABOUT THE WELFARE OF UP, HE STRIKES AN OMINOUS BLOW THAT TAKES US BACK TO THE PAST. SOME BACKGROUND. WITH THE CAVEAT THAT I AM THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK ON MODI AND AMIT SHAH AND THEIR ROLE IN THE GUJARAT RIOTS, I QUOTE FROM A SPEECH THAT MODI AS CHIEF MINISTER IN GUJARAT IN 2002 DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN THE STATE: "I TOLD THEM THAT I GOT WATER FROM IN THE MONTH OF SHRAVAN. IF THEY IT THEIR WAY, THEY WOULD HAVE GOT IT IN RAMAZAN...WHAT SHOULD WE DO? RUN RELIEF CAMPS FOR THEM? DO WE WANT TO OPEN BABY-PRODUCING CENTRES? WE ARE FIVE AND WE WILL HAVE 25 OFFSPRING. GUJARAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL ITS POPULATION AND POOR PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ." BACK TO THE PRESENT DAY. 15 YEARS LATER, MODIJI IS THE PM OF OUR COUNTRY. HE IS THE VIKAS PURUSH WHO TALKS OF A 56-INCH CHEST TO PROTECT HIS COUNTRYMEN AGAINST ALL ODDS.
