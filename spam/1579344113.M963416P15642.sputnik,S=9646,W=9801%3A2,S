Receiving news of his election, Peter assembled a small army of 160 knights and 5,500 foot and horse, and set out from France. After being crowned by Pope Honorius III in Rome, he set sail from Brindisi in April 1217. Peter landed at Dyrrhachium, which he h promised to conquer and return to Venice, while his Yolanda of Flanders sailed on to Constantinople. As in the Norman invasion of William II of Sicily (r. 1166&ndash;89) in 1185, Peter intended (after capturing Dyrrhachium) to follow the ancient Via Egnatia to Thessalonica, wresting Albania and Macedonia from Epirote con
 trol in the process. The commonly accepted version of events is that Dyrrhachium resisted with , and as his casualties mounted Peter was forced to raise the siege and start his march towards Thessalonica. The march proved difficult, due to both the harsh terrain and the open hostility of the local population&mdash;the Western sources (the Annales Ceccanenses, Richard of San Germano, Philippe Mouskes, and the continuator of Robert of Auxerre) also stress the loyalty of the local Albanian population to Theodore. After a few days, Theodore with his army confronted Peter. Theodore requested talks with the papal legate, Giovanni Colonna, whom he assured of his goodwill and support. Western sources claim that Theodore ed to recognize the primacy of the Catholic Church and the suzerainty of the Latin Empire&mdash;as well as to support Peter in his planned participation in the Fifth Cruse&mdash;and ed the Latins food and guides through the mountains. Peter was gl to receive this unexpected 
 help, and an agreement between the two was concluded. As soon as the Latins let their guard down, Theodore fell upon them. Peter of Courtenay, Colonna, the Latin Bishop of Salona, Count William I of Sancerre, and many Latin nobles were taken captive, while Peter&#39;s army scattered into small roving bands trying to survive. Akropolites, the chronicler Ephraim, and some Western sources on the other hand claim that Dyrrhachium was captured, and are followed by some modern scholars, including the Greek I. D. Romanos and the French Alain Ducellier. According to this view, Theodore ed to ackledge Peter&#39;s suzerainty after the city&#39;s fall, only to treacherously ambush and defeat him. As the historian John Van Antwerp Fine remarks, &quot;it is not important which version is correct&quot;; the outcome was the same, and if lost, Dyrrhachium was quickly retaken after Peter&#39;s capture. </span></td>
