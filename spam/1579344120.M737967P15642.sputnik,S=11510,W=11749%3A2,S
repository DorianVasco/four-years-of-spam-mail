Hi,..it's Thomas M. Fleming here...
Trump is one of more than 80 million men and women in the U.S. who suffer from some degree of hair loss, and this could be a conservative estimate.
==> http://www.sttaudfr.xyz/3903-889-1621-17731185/mail/tindex15.html
His long-time physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein said that the president takes a remedy to stimulate hair growth.

There’s natural solution that uses the body’s chemistry to literally force your hair to stay put, grow back, and be stronger.

Learn all about it in this short video.

If you struggle with thinning hair, you definitely want to spend the next 3 minutes watching the video...

It’s just been released to the American public. Finally you can regrow thick, youthful hair again.

CHOOSE WALNUTS THAT HAVE FIRM SHELLS WHICH ARE NOT CRACKED OR STAINED. AVOID WALNUTS WHICH LOOK RUBBERY OR SHRIVELED. ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT SMELL RANCID. FOR LONGEST POSSIBLE STORAGE, WALNUTS MUST BE REFRIGERATED IN AN AIR-TIGHT CONTAINER AND SHOULD BE MINIMAL HUMIDITY. THEY ARE HIGHLY PERISHABLE AND MUST BE KEPT IN A COOL, DRY AND DARK PLACE. CHAROLI OR CHIRONJI IS AN INDIAN MEDICINAL PLANT USED AS A SPICE AND IN DESSERTS. IT IS ALSO MELON SEED AND HAS A TASTE SIMILAR TO ALMONDS. THE SEED IS LENTIL-SIZED AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED. THOUGH IT CAN BE EATEN RAW, THE EDIBLE SEED CONTAINS LIGHT ACIDIC FLAVOUR, AND IS CONSUMED BOTH RAW AND FRIED. HOWEVER, FRIED SEEDS ARE MORE TASTEFUL. THE CHIRONJI PLANT IS COMMONLY FOUND IN THE REGIONS OF INDIA, NEPAL AND BURMA. VERY COMMONLY CHIRONJI IS IN SWEET DISHES LIKE KHEER, KULFI AND RICE PUDDINGS. CHIRONJI OIL IS OFTEN TREATED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ALMOND OIL DURING MEDICINAL PRACTICES. IT IS ALSO OFTEN USED TO PROVIDE FROM ITCHING AND CAN ALSO BE U
 SED AS A FACE CLEANSER. APART FROM THE SEED, VARIOUS OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT ARE ALSO VERY BENEFICIAL IN SEVERAL WAYS. THE GUM EXUDED FROM THE BARK IS EMPLOYED TO CURE DIARRHOEA. THE ROOTS AND ARE BATTERED AND CONSUMED WITH BUTTERMILK. FROM THE PLANT ARE ALSO USED TO TREAT VARIOUS SKIN DISEASES. CHAROLI SEEDS ARE ALSO USED IN AYURVEDA AND UNANI MEDICINE. ONE WAY TO INCLUDE GOOD FAT IN YOUR DIET IS TO USE CANOLA OIL FOR COOKING. IT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SATURATED FAT TO OTHER COMMONLY USED OILS, MAKING IT IDEAL FOR A RANGE OF USES FROM TO SAUTÉING. CANOLA OIL 2. EDIBLE SEEDS ARE NUTRITIOUS EATING JUST ONE TABLESPOON OF CHIA SEEDS WILL GIVE YOU 19 PERCENT OF YOUR RECOMMENDED DAILY FIBER INTAKE IN TO CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, IRON, ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS AND ANTIOXIDANTS.  FISH OIL IS ONE SUCH EXAMPLE. THE RICH PRESENCE OF OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS IS WHAT MAKES FISH OIL HEALTHY. OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS ARE ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS THAT THE HUMAN BODY IS UNABLE TO PRODUCE ON ITS OWN. THE TWO MAIN OMEG
 A-3 FATTY ACIDS ARE DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID (DHA) AND EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID (EPA). THE HUMAN BODY CANNOT MAKE OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID; WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THIS ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID EITHER THROUGH OUR DIET OR THROUGH DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT OMEGA-3 HELPS THE BODY PRODUCE CHEMICALS THAT, IN TURN, HELP CONTROL INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY.
