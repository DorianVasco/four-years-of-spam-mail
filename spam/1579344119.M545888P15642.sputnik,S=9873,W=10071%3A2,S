 THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW OF BLOOD TEST, TO DETECT CANCER AND LOCATE THE PLACE IN THE BODY THE TUMOUR IS . THIS DEVELOPMENT IS ESPECIALLY PATH-BREAKING AS IT WILL HELP THE CANCER PATIENTS GET RID OF PAINFUL SURGICAL PROCEDURES LIKE BIOPSIES. THESE CANCER BLOOD TESTS WORK BY SCREENING FOR THE DNA THAT IS RELEASED BY THE DYING TUMOUR CELLS, WHICH IT DETECTS TRACES OF TUMOUR DNA IN THE CANCER PATIENT’S BLOOD. AS THE NORMAL CELLS DIE WHILE COMPETING WITH THE TUMOR, THEY RELEASE THEIR DNA INTO THE BLOODSTREAM, SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THIS DNA CAN PROVE EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTIVE TISSUE. KUN ZHANG, PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO IN THE US, HIGHLIGHTED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DETECTING THE TUMOUR’S LOCATION, “THE TUMOUR'S LOCATION IS CRITICAL FOR EFFECTIVE EARLY DETECTION". THIS NEW METHOD LOOKS FOR A PARTICULAR DNA SIGNATURE CPG METHYLATION HAPLOTYPES. THE UNIQUE SIGNATURE OF METHYLATION HAPLOTYPES CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERISE EVERY TISSUE IN
  THE BODY. INTEGRATING BOTH CANCER CELL AND OTHER CELLS SIGNALS, CAN FURTHER HELP DETERMINE THE ABSENCE AND PRESENCE OF THE TUMOUR AND STUDY IT IS AND ITS RATE OF GROWTH. FOR THE STUDY, THE SCIENTISTS PUT TOGETHER A DATABASE OF THE COMPLETE CPG METHYLATION PATTERNS OF 10 DIFFERENT NORMAL TISSUES OF BLOOD, INTESTINE, LIVER, LUNG,COLON, BRAIN, KIDNEY, PANCREAS, SPLEEN AND STOMACH. TUMOUR AND BLOOD SAMPLES OF CANCER PATIENTS WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED FOR SIGNALS OF CANCER MARKERS AND TISSUE-SPECIFIC METHYLATION PATTERNS. ARE MANY TYPES OF PEANUTS THAT ARE GROWN. BUT THE MOST COMMON CULTIVAR ARE SPANISH, RUNNER, VIRGINIA, VALENCIA AND TENESSE. THEIR USE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND OIL CONTENT. COMMERCIAL PEANUTS THAT ARE COMMONLY FOUND IN SHELLS ARE OF THE VIRGINIA TYPE AND THE SPANISH PEANUTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PREFERRED FOR PEANUT BUTTER, AS SALTED NUTS OR FOR CANDIES. PEANUTS ARE A VERY COMMON SNACK WHEN THEY ARE CONSUMED WITHOUT THIER SHELLS. PEANUT FLOUR IS SOMETIMES USED AS IT
  HAS A HIGH PROTEIN CONTENT. PEANUTS, ALSO AS GROUNDNUTS ARE A NUTRITIOUS LEGUME FOUND ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY ARE SAID TO HAVE ORIGINATED IN SOUTH AMERICA. THEY CAN BE USED FOR DIRECT CONSUMPTION, IN FOOD PREPARATIONS, FOR DERIVING OIL, MAKING PEANUT FLOUR OR IN THE PREPARATION OF PEANUT BUTTER. THEY CONTRIBUTE IN IMPROVING THE MENTAL FUNCTIONS AND BLOOD FLOW.
