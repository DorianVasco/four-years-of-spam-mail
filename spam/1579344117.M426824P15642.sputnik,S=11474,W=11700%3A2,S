COME AND OUR FRUIT STALLS ARE DOMINATED BY STRAWBERRIES, PERSIMMONS, STAR FRUIT, WATER CHESTNUTS () AND ORANGES. MY FAVOURITE OUT OF ALL THESE IS THE STRIKING-LOOKING , BUT I DO RESERVE A SOFT SPOT IN MY HEART FOR ORANGES. THIS TIME OF YEAR, THEY ARE USUALLY SWEET, BUT EVEN WHEN SOUR THEY HAVE A REFRESHINGLY CRISP JUICINESS. WHAT'S MORE, THEY ARE A WONDERFULLY VERSATILE FRUIT. A BEAUTIFULLY-BURNISHED, TANGY IS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN ONE TALKS ABOUT ORANGES, BUT ARE PLENTY OF OTHER DISHES THAT THEY CAN BE USED IN. LET US FIRST TALK ABOUT THE OBVIOUS ONES - SWEETS AND PUDDINGS. ORANGES LEND THEMSELVES PERFECTLY TO LIGHT, FLUFFY SOUFFLÉS AND COLD JELLIES. CANDIED ORANGES ARE OFTEN USED IN FRUITCAKES AND TASTE WONDERFUL WHEN PAIRED WITH SUGARED WATER TO MAKE GRANITAS AND SORBETS. AND DON'T THROW AWAY THE RIND AFTER YOU ARE DONE PEELING THE FRUIT. ORANGE RIND OR ZEST PACKS A WALLOP OF FLAVOUR, AND HELPS INTENSIFY THE ORANGE FLAVOUR IN ANY DISH. AND YOU CAN USE THEM TO MA
 KE CANDIED PEELS, WHICH ARE A DELICIOUS, SWEET SNACK. IS THE RECIPE BELOW. THE GLORIOUS, REFRESHING FLAVOUR OF THE ORANGE PERKS UP CONSIDERABLY. ARE A FEW TIME-TESTED (AND TASTED) PAIRINGS THAT WORK EVERY TIME - ORANGES AND BEETROOTS, THE HEAVY SWEETNESS OF THE BEET OFFSETTING THE LIGHT, TANGY ORANGE; ORANGES AND SPINACH, A BEAUTIFUL PLAY ON THE BITTERSWEET; ROCKET , ORANGE AND WALNUT , WITH ITS DELIGHTFUL TEXTURAL VARIATIONS AND THE SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL ORANGE AND DATE , FOR WHICH I AM GIVING YOU MY RECIPE BELOW. ORANGES CERTAINLY STAR IN MANY MEAT-BASED DISHES. THEY PAIR SPECTACULARLY WELL WITH PORCINE DISHES AND WITH POULTRY. MY FRIEND EVEN SWEARS BY HER MOROCCAN ORANGE LAMB RECIPE! THE CLASSIC FRENCH DISH, DUCK À L’ORANGE, IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE A BIT OF A CLICHÉ BUT IS ACTUALLY QUITE DELICIOUS. THE ORIGINAL RECIPE FOR A WHOLE DUCK (A LUXURIOUS EXTRAVAGANCE FOR MOST OF US!) AND MIGHT SEEM A BIT INTIMIDATING, BUT IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD TO PREPARE. THE ORANGE IS JUICED AND
  USED AS A FOR THE DUCK, TOGETHER WITH THE PEEL. LATER, ORANGE JUICE ALONG WITH VINEGAR AND SUGAR (WITH A LITTLE BUTTER WHISKED IN) IS USED AS A SAUCE. CRISPY-SKINNED, CITRUS-INFUSED DUCK TOGETHER WITH A RICH, TANGY SAUCE MAKES FOR A DELICIOUS DISH ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS. BANGALORE IS A ON EVERY TURN. IT IS STILL REMINISCENT OF THE SLEEPY OLD TOWN WHICH WAS UNEXPECTEDLY (AND A BIT RELUCTANTLY) THROWN INTO THE DIZZYING WORLD OF A BUSTLING METROPOLITAN. OLD BANGLOREANS OFTEN LAMENT THE POPULATION THAT CAME POURING IN WITH THE CITY BECOMING AN IT HUB, AND MORE RECENTLY, A STARTUP HUB. TRAFFIC BECAME A NIGHTMARE IN A CITY THE ROMANTIC ALLEYS COULDN’T HANDLE THE SWELLING PRESSURES OF MILLIONS OF CARS. BUT WITH ANY CHANGE, ALSO COME ITS OWN SET OF .
