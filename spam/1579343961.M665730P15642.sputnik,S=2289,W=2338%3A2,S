Hi,

I am Eric 19, of Late Professor Nsabinama Tom from Rwanda. I got your e-mai=
l in the internet while searching for a business partner who will assist me=
 to repatriate the amount of $21 million belonging to my father in a foreig=
n bank.

I was adopted to my late father at the age of 1/3 months according to my fa=
ther, and I am the only child and heir apparent until the uncle was accused=
 of plotting with the people who killed him because of the family land prop=
erty which forced me to ran away.

See my personal e-mail:  ericonosi@yahoo.com  for you to contact me if you =
want to help and for me to know where to meet with you.

Eric
