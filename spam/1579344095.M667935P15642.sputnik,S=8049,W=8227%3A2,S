YOUR BODY USES PROTEIN TO BUILD AND REPAIR TISSUES. YOU ALSO USE PROTEIN TO MAKE ENZYMES, HORMONES, AND OTHER BODY CHEMICALS. PROTEIN IS AN IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK OF BONES, MUSCLES, CARTILAGE, SKIN, AND BLOOD. BODY BUILDERS ARE SNATCHING, GRABBING, AND GULPING DOWN PROTEIN SHAKES. YOURSELF WELL HYDRATED AT ALL TIMES. DEHYDRATION MAY OFTEN TO MOOD . YOUR BRAIN NEEDS HEALTHY FATS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. SO, DON’T IGNORE ALL FATS. FOOD LIKE OILY FISH, POULTRY, NUTS, EGGS, AND SEEDS CONTAIN GOOD FATS. MAKE SURE YOU GET ENOUGH PROTEIN FROM LEAN MEAT, LENTILS OR SOYA. PROTEINS CONTAIN AMINO ACIDS THAT HELP IN PRODUCING CERTAIN CHEMICALS WHICH YOUR BRAIN NEED TO PROCESS FEELINGS. KEEP YOUR GUT HEALTHY. EAT LOTS OF FRUIT AND VEGGIES THAT ARE FULL OF FIBRE ALONG WITH PROBIOTICS LIKE YOGURT. YOUR BRAIN IS CONSTANTLY COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR GUT THAT SENDS SIGNALS ABOUT INDULGE IN GREEN TEA OR LEMON AND HONEY INFUSIONS. THEY WILL HELP YOU IN KEEPING YOUR ENERGY LEVELS UP. AS THE DAY PROGRESSES
 , YOU CAN SWITCH TO BUTTERMILK, CARROT AND BEETROOT JUICE, A GLASS OF NIMBU PAANI, FRESH COCONUT WATER AND A BIG BOWL OF CLEAR SOUP FOR DINNER. STEER CLEAR OF SUGAR. AS VALENTINE’S DAY APPROACHES US, WE SUDDENLY START WEIGHING OURSELVES IN ORDER TO FIT IN THE MOST GORGEOUS DRESS THAT WE HAVE SPECIALLY BOUGHT FOR THAT LOVELY OCCASION. WE WANT TO SHED ALL THE EXTRA INCHES AND THAT TOO QUICKLY. BUT THE MAGIC WAND DOES NO WONDERS WHEN IT COMES TO LOSING WEIGHT! DON’T FRET BECAUSE WE HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. WE ASKED NUTRITIONIST DR.
