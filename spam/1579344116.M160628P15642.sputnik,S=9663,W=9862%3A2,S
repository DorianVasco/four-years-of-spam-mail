WILL BE ROUGH.” HIS FRIEND FROM MEXICO SHARED THIS SUPERSTITION WITH HIM. HOME FOOD & DRINKS 5 FAMOUS INDIAN CHEFS REVEAL SURPRISING KITCHEN SUPERSTITIONS THEY BELIEVE IN 5 FAMOUS INDIAN CHEFS REVEAL SURPRISING KITCHEN SUPERSTITIONS THEY BELIEVE IN SMRITI AGARWAL | UPDATED: MARCH 03, 2017 12:27 IST TWEETER FACEBOOK GOOGLE PLUS REDDIT 5 FAMOUS INDIAN CHEFS REVEAL SURPRISING KITCHEN SUPERSTITIONS THEY BELIEVE IN HIGHLIGHTS WE ARE STILL IN A WORLD FULL OF SUPERSTITIONS. MAXIMUM SUPERSTITIONS COME FROM KITCHENS! LUCK OR EVIL. THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE BUT WE FOLLOW THEM PERHAPS FOR OUR OWN MENTAL SATISFACTION AND PEACE. A WHOLE LOT OF SUPERSTITIONS EXIST AROUND FOOD AND COOKING AS WELL. WE ASKED FIVE CELEBRITY CHEFS TO SHARE SOME KITCHEN SUPERSTITIONS THAT THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN AND FOLLOW. YOU'D BE SURPRISED. 1. CHEF RANVEER BRAR "I BELIEVE IN DROPPING SOME SALT ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR BEFORE I COMMENCE WITH MY COOKING. ALSO, I MAKE SURE THAT I AM IN THE KITCHEN AROUND 12 0’ CLOCK 
 EVERY NEW YEAR AS IT BRINGS GOOD LUCK TO ME”. RANVEER BRAR IS A CELEBRATED CHEF, TV HOST, JUDGE AND FOOD STYLIST. 2. CHEF VAIBHAV BHARGAVA THE EXECUTIVE CHEF AT PAN ASIAN, ITC SHERATON HOTEL IN NEW DELHI AND A MASTER IN THE ART OF COOKING ASIAN CUISINE, HE SAYS, “IN THE CHINESE KITCHEN, I TOUCH THE WOK RANGE FOR BRINGING FRESH AND INNOVATIVE CULINARY ART TO HIS KITCHEN OUT OF HIS EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS AND TRAVELING ALL OVER THE WORLD. HE BELIEVES, “WHEN I SET THE CURD, I PUT A DRIED CHILLI ON TOP OF THE BOWL SO THAT IT SETS WELL. ALSO, WHEN A NEW TANDOOR COMES INTO MY KITCHEN I WORSHIP IT BEFORE I COMMENCE COOKING ON IT.” 4. CHEF VIKRAM KHATRI CHEF VIKRAM IS FIERCELY DEVOTED TO FRESHNESS, HYGIENE AND TECHNIQUE. HE AND HIS TEAM HAVE WON MANY AWARDS WHILE WORKING AT GUPPY BY AI IN NEW DELHI WHICH INCLUDE THE BEST SUSHI CHEF AND INTERNATIONAL CHEF OF THE YEAR FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. HE TELLS US,“I DON’T BELIEVE IN STATING ANY  SOME SAY 
 THAT IF THE APRON COMES OUT OR FALLS OFF WHILE WORKING IN THE KITCHEN IT IS A SIGN THAT SOMEONE IS THINKING OF YOU. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT IF A FORK ACCIDENTALLY FALLS ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR A MALE VISITOR WILL KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR SOON AND IF A SPOON FALLS OFF A FEMALE VISITOR IS EXPECTED. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT MOST CHEFS ARE ALSO A BIT PICKY ABOUT SHARING THEIR KNIVES OR PASSING IT TO ANY OTHER PERSON.
