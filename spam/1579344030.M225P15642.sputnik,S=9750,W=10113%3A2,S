Hi,

● You may find this Shocking, but a 104 year old retired Neuroscientist 
has developed a sequence of simple "mind twisting exercises" 
that have been proven to profoundly improve your mental capabilities.

● Long lost memories, like when you met your first lover, 
return with pristine clarity, as if it just happened...
http://www.fgnvkre.us/3097-525-1236-17731185/mail/tindex30.html

● And all it takes is just a couple minutes each day for only 
14 days, and you can re-program the way your brain works, forever.


Enjoy,
Terry Craig

In 1993, the city passed a massive redevelopment package known as the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS), intended to rebuild the city's core with civic projects to establish more activities and life to downtown. The city added a new baseball park; central library; renovations to the civic center, convention center and fairgrounds; and a water canal in the Bricktown entertainment district. Water taxis transport passengers within the district, adding color and activity along the canal. MAPS has become one of the most successful public-private partnerships undertaken in the U.S., exceeding $3 billion in private investment as of 2010.[26] As a result of MAPS, the population living in downtown housing has exponentially increased, together with demand for additional residential and retail amenities, such as grocery, services, and shops.

Since the MAPS projects' completion, the downtown area has seen continued development. Several downtown buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. Notable among these was the restoration of the Skirvin Hotel in 2007. The famed First National Center is being renovated.

Residents of Oklahoma City suffered substantial losses on April 19, 1995 when Timothy McVeigh detonated a bomb in front of the Murrah building. The building was destroyed (the remnants of which had to be im
