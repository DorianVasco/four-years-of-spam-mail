MAXIMUM SUPERSTITIONS COME FROM KITCHENS! SOME OF THEM BY GREAT CHEFS. NO MATTER HOW MODERN OUR LIFESTYLE OR THINKING MIGHT GET, ARE SOME OLD TIME BELIEFS AND CHARMS WHICH WILL STOP LINGERING ON IN OUR MINDS. MOST OF US MAY HAVE BECOME VERY PRACTICAL IN OUR DAILY LIVES, BUT SOME OF US STILL CONTINUE TO CLING ON TO SOME PRACTICES OR SUPERSTITIONS FOR MANY YEARS. WE BELIEVE IN THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 'LUCKY' FOR US. IT'S REASSURING THAT THESE PRACTICES OR BELIEFS PROTECT US, IN SOME WAY, FROM ANY KIND OF LUCK OR EVIL. THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE BUT WE FOLLOW THEM PERHAPS FOR OUR OWN MENTAL SATISFACTION AND PEACE. A WHOLE LOT OF SUPERSTITIONS EXIST AROUND FOOD AND COOKING AS WELL. WE ASKED FIVE CELEBRITY CHEFS TO SHARE SOME KITCHEN SUPERSTITIONS THAT THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN AND FOLLOW. YOU'D BE SURPRISED. 1. CHEF RANVEER BRAR "I BELIEVE IN DROPPING SOME SALT ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR BEFORE I COMMENCE WITH MY COOKING. ALSO, I MAKE SURE THAT I AM IN THE KITCHEN AROUND 12 0’ CLO
 CK EVERY NEW YEAR AS IT BRINGS GOOD LUCK TO ME”. RANVEER BRAR IS A CELEBRATED CHEF, TV HOST, JUDGE AND FOOD STYLIST. 2. CHEF VAIBHAV BHARGAVA THE EXECUTIVE CHEF AT PAN ASIAN, ITC SHERATON HOTEL IN NEW DELHI AND A MASTER IN THE ART OF COOKING ASIAN CUISINE, HE SAYS, “IN THE CHINESE KITCHEN, I TOUCH THE WOK RANGE THE FOOD IS COOKED BEFORE I START COOKING AS A OF WORSHIP JUST LIKE WE TOUCH THE FEET OF GOD SO AS TO PREVENT ANY KIND OF MISHAP OR ACCIDENTS AS THEY REQUIRE HIGH PRESSURE FIRE FOR COOKING.” 3. CHEF NEERAJ TYAGI CHEF TYAGI IS EXECUTIVE CHEF AT SHANGRILA EROS HOTEL IN NEW DELHI AND IS FOR BRINGING FRESH AND INNOVATIVE CULINARY ART TO HIS KITCHEN OUT OF HIS EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS AND TRAVELING ALL OVER THE WORLD. HE BELIEVES, “WHEN I SET THE CURD, I PUT A DRIED CHILLI ON TOP OF THE BOWL SO THAT IT SETS WELL. ALSO, WHEN A NEW TANDOOR COMES INTO MY KITCHEN I WORSHIP IT BEFORE I COMMENCE COOKING ON IT.” 4. CHEF VIKRAM KHATRI CHEF VIKRAM 
 IS FIERCELY DEVOTED TO FRESHNESS, HYGIENE AND TECHNIQUE. HE AND HIS TEAM HAVE WON MANY AWARDS WHILE WORKING AT GUPPY BY AI IN NEW DELHI WHICH INCLUDE THE BEST SUSHI CHEF AND INTERNATIONAL CHEF OF THE YEAR FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. HE TELLS US,“I DON’T BELIEVE IN STATING ANY TARGETS AS I FEEL THAT MAY TO CANCELLATION OF RESERVATIONS. I DON’T LIKE PREDICTING ANY NUMBER EVEN WHEN I SEE A LOT OF WALK-INS." CHEF (PHOTO : FACEBOOK/VIKRAM KHATRI) 5. CHEF VICKY RATNANI CHEF VICKY RATNANI IS A POPULAR INDIAN CHEF AND ALSO HOSTS A COOKING SHOW ON NDTV GOODTIMES. HE SHARES, “EAT 12 GRAPES AT MIDNIGHT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. ALSO, HAVE A GRAPE AT THE BEGINNING OF A MONTH TO PREDICT HOW IT IS GOING TO TURN OUT. IF THE GRAPE IS SWEET THE MONTH WILL GO WELL IF YOU HAVE A SOUR GRAPE THE MONTH WILL BE ROUGH.” HIS FRIEND FROM MEXICO SHARED THIS SUPERSTITION WITH HIM. THIS IS NOT ALL, ARE MANY OTHER SUPERSTITIONS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY FOLLOW WHEN IT COMES TO COOKING. SOME SAY THAT IF THE APRON CO
 MES OUT OR FALLS OFF WHILE WORKING IN THE KITCHEN IT IS A SIGN THAT SOMEONE IS THINKING OF YOU. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT IF A FORK ACCIDENTALLY FALLS ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR A MALE VISITOR WILL KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR SOON AND IF A SPOON FALLS OFF A FEMALE VISITOR IS EXPECTED. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT MOST CHEFS ARE ALSO A BIT PICKY ABOUT SHARING THEIR KNIVES OR PASSING IT TO ANY OTHER PERSON.
