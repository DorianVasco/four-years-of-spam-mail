COMBING THEM WITH GRAINS HELPS IN MAKING THEM A COMPLETE PROTEIN. USE THEM IN , SANDWICHES OR TO MAKE FAMOUS PUNJABI RAJMA. IF YOU FIND THEM DIFFICULT TO DIGEST, DRINK A LOT OF FLUIDS THROUGH THE DAY IF YOU’RE LOOKING TO UP ON ANTIOXIDANTS, HAVE A HANDFUL OF RAISINS. DARK RAISINS ARE PACKED WITH ANTHOCYANINS THAT GIVE YOU AN ENERGY BOOST. SPRINKLE THEM ON YOUR BREAKFAST OATS, THROW THEM IN A OR BLEND SOME WITH YOUR SMOOTHIE. INTERESTINGLY, RAISINS CONTAIN AT LEAST THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF ANTIOXIDANTS AS GRAPES THIS ANCIENT GRAIN IS TRENDING AGAIN AND FOR GOOD REASON. BARLEY IS FOR ITS POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES THAT MAKE YOU STRONGER FROM WITHIN. ALSO, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT WHEN GRAINS LIKE BARLEY ARE SOAKED AND SPROUTED THE ANTIOXIDANT LEVELS INCREASE. MOREOVER, THEY BECOME MORE DIGESTIBLE AND IT IS EASIER FOR THE BODY TO ABSORB THEIR NUTRIENTS. IN THE RECENT YEARS, THIS HUMBLE VEGETABLE HAS CREATED A LOT OF NOISE BECAUSE OF ITS CANCER-FIGHTING ANTIOXIDANTS. OUT OF ALL THE
  CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES, BROCCOLI IS ONE OF THE BEST SOURCES OF ANTIOXIDANTS LIKE CAROTENOIDS LUTEIN, ZEAXANTHIN AND BETA-CAROTENE. THE BEST WAY TO HAVE BROCCOLI IS TO STEAM IT. REMEMBER THAT SOME ANTIOXIDANTS LIKE VITAMIN C ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY HEAT WHILE OTHERS LIKE BETA-CAROTENE BECOME MORE POTENT ON COOKING THE VEGETABLE. IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, ALCOHOL HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A DEPRESSANT, IT MAY GIVE YOUR A TEMPORARY HIGH THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. THE SIDE EFFECTS DEPEND ON KIND OF ALCOHOL YOU TAKE REGULARLY AND ALSO THE AMOUNT. WHILE IT REMAINS AN UNDISPUTED FACT THAT DRINKING EXCESS OF ALCOHOL IS FOR YOUR HEALTH, A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT EVEN HALF A PINT CAN PROVE HAZARDOUS IN A LONG RUN INCREASING THEIR RISK OF HEART DISEASE BY PREMATURELY AGEING THEIR ARTERIES. THE FACT REMAINS THAT TOO MUCH ALCOHOL CAN HARM YOUR HEALTH IN MORE THAN ONE WAY BUT HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH? FOR HEALTHY MEN, DRINKING MORE THA
 N 4 DRINKS ON ANY DAY AND FOR HEALTHY WOMEN HAVING MORE THAN THREE FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF 'HEAVY DRINKING'. ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, MALE DRINKERS WERE ALSO AT RISK AS TO MODERATE DRINKERS WHO WERE IN EARLY OLD AGE. OUR LIVER'S MAIN JOB IS TO BREAKDOWN HARMFUL SUBSTANCES AND EXCRETE THEM FROM OUR BODY. DRINKING TOO MUCH ALCOHOL PUTS EXCESSIVE ON YOUR LIVER WHICH CAN CAUSE ALCOHOL HEPATITIS OR EVEN CAUSE INFLAMMATION. A NEW STUDY TO THE LIST OF HARMFUL EFFECTS OF HEAVING DRINKING ESPECIALLY FOR MEN
