THE GOVERNMENT USED INTENSIVE POLICE OPERATIONS TO CRUSH MILITANT OPERATIONS, BUT IT RESULTED IN MANY OF ABUSE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES. NORTHEAST INDIA WAS PARALYSED TO THE ULFA'S CLASH WITH GOVERNMENT FORCES. ON 31 OCTOBER 1984, THE PRIME MINISTER'S OWN SIKH BODYGUARDS ASSASSINATED HER, AND 1984 ANTI-SIKH RIOTS ERUPTED IN DELHI AND PARTS OF PUNJAB, CAUSING THE DEATHS OF SIKHS ALONG WITH TERRIBLE PILLAGE, ARSON AND RAPE. SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS PARTY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN STIRRING THE VIOLENCE AGAINST SIKHS. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION HAS FAILED TO DATE TO DISCOVER THE CAUSES AND PUNISH THE PERPETRATORS, BUT PUBLIC OPINION BLAMED CONGRESS FOR DIRECTING ATTACKS ON SIKHS IN DELHI. THE CONGRESS PARTY CHOSE RAJIV GANDHI, INDIRA'S OLDER SON AS THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER. RAJIV BEEN ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT ONLY IN 1982, AND AT 40, WAS THE YOUNGEST NATIONAL POLITICAL AND PRIME MINISTER EVER. BUT HIS YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE WERE AN ASSET IN THE EYES OF CITIZENS TIRED OF THE INEFFICACY AND CORRUP
 TION OF CAREER POLITICIANS,AND LOOKING FOR NEWER POLICIES AND A FRESH START TO RESOLVE THE COUNTRY'S LONG-STANDING PROBLEMS. THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED, AND RAJIV LED THE CONGRESS PARTY TO ITS LARGEST MAJORITY IN HISTORY (OVER 415 SEATS OUT OF 545 POSSIBLE), REAPING A SYMPATHY VOTE OVER HIS MOTHER'S ASSASSINATION. FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND IMPORTS DECREASED CONSIDERABLY. THIS ALLOWED PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO USE RESOURCES AND PRODUCE COMMERCIAL GOODS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY INTERFERING, AND THE INFLUX OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASED INDIA'S NATIONAL RESERVES. AS PRIME MINISTER, RAJIV BROKE FROM HIS MOTHER'S PRECEDENT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCREASED ECONOMIC AID AND SCIENTIFIC CO-OPERATION. RAJIV'S ENCOURAGEMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESULTED IN A MAJOR EXPANSION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY, INDIA'S SPACE PROGRAMME AND GAVE BIRTH TO THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.
