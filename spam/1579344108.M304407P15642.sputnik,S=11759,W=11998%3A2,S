HE WAS PROBABLY REFERRING TO A TUCKER CARLSON INTERVIEW WITH AMI HOROWITZ. THE FILMMAKER HAS BLAMED REFUGEES FOR A PURPORTED CRIME WAVE IN SWEDEN AND ALLEGED THAT AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING TO COVER UP THE INCIDENTS. WHITE HOUSE SPOKESWOMAN SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, THE MATTER ON SUNDAY, TOLD REPORTERS THAT TRUMP "WAS TALKING ABOUT RISING CRIME AND RECENT INCIDENTS IN GENERAL AND NOT REFERRING TO A SPECIFIC INCIDENT." TRUMP'S NEW TWEET CAME AFTER SPECULATION OVER THE INCIDENT HE REFERRED TO CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR NEARLY A DAY. ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT EXPLICITLY SAY IT, HIS REMARKS WERE WIDELY PERCEIVED AS SUGGESTING THAT AN ATTACK OCCURRED FRIDAY NIGHT IN SWEDEN. "SWEDEN? TERROR ATTACK? WHAT HAS HE BEEN SMOKING? QUESTIONS ABOUND," SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER CARL BILDT SAID ON TWITTER. OTHERS REACTED BY POSTING PHOTOS OF HOW THEY BELIEVE SWEDEN REALLY LOOKED FRIDAY NIGHT, USING THE HASHTAG #LASTNIGHTINSWEDEN. THE WHITE HOUSE FACED CRITICISM THIS MONTH AFTER IT INCLUDED AN INCIDENT IN THE SW
 EDISH CITY OF MALMO ON ITS LIST OF ALLEGEDLY UNDERREPORTED TERRORIST ATTACKS. IN OCTOBER, ARSON CAUSED SMOKE DAMAGE AT AN IRAQI COMMUNITY CENTER IN MALMO. A JUDGE, HOWEVER, RULED THAT WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS A "TERROR ATTACK" - MONTHS BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED THE LIST THAT REFERRED TO THE INCIDENT. SWEDEN TOOK IN MORE REFUGEES PER CAPITA THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE MIGRANT INFLUX IN 2015. THE COUNTRY HAS LONG VIEWED ITSELF AS HAVING A MORAL TO TAKE IN REFUGEES FROM WAR-TORN COUNTRIES. BUT SWEDEN REACHED ITS LIMITS AS OTHER EUROPEAN UNION NEIGHBORS REFUSED TO FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS. THE INFLUX OF REFUGEES HAS NOT COME WITHOUT PROBLEMS IN SWEDEN, BUT MAINSTREAM POLITICIANS AND IMMIGRATION EXPERTS SAY THE CRITICISM HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATE. IN SUMMER 2016, SWEDISH EMBASSIES WERE TASKED TO COUNTER RUMORS OR FALSE ABOUT SWEDEN'S EXPERIENCE WITH TAKING IN LARGE NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS. SPEAKING FRIDAY, ONE DAY BEFORE TRUMP HIS REMARKS, HENR
 IK SELIN OF THE SWEDISH INSTITUTE SAID ARE "PEOPLE WHOSE POLITICAL AGENDA SUGGESTS THEY WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE STORY OF COUNTRIES NOT BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT MANY REFUGEES, WHO SEEM TO WANT TO EXAGGERATE PROBLEMS," ACCORDING TO SWEDEN. ALTHOUGH SWEDEN VIEWS ITSELF AS REASINGLY ISOLATED IN REGARD TO ITS PRO-IMMIGRATION STANCE, THE COUNTRY FOUND SUPPORT ON SOCIAL MEDIA SUNDAY. "DEAR @REALDONALDTRUMP," ALEXANDER STUBB, A PRIME MINISTER OF FINLAND, TWEETED. "SWEDEN IS IMMIGRATION FRIENDLY, INTERNATIONAL & LIBERAL. ONE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS, RICHEST, SAFEST PLACES ON EARTH.
