I can remember when I first committed to Paleo.

My energy was bursting. Fat was flying off.
My health was returning with a vengeance.

For breakfast Sizzling strips of bacon and eggs sunny side up.

Who knew bacon and eggs would be the catalyst of my Paleo
transformation?

Every day, I'd wake up, and look forward to the sound, the
smell, the taste.

Until one day I didn't.

Paleohacks Cookbooks

I had to admit to myself, I was sick of them.
Not just bored or fed up of the taste, but truly SICK of them.

Now I was in a quandary. What to eat. What to do?

Going back to previously unhealthy options was out of the
question. It'd been months since I had an English muffin,
a donut or bowl of cereal.

And skipping breakfast altogether was simply not an option.

Scouring the Internet for a tasty and satisfying Paleo
breakfast ideas proved frustrating and time consuming.

And then suddenly I discovered these recipes from Paleohacks
PaleohacksPaleo Breakfast Recipes

Hm, delicious. Recipe after recipe, everything I tried,
tasted sooo good.

Now I finally had what I craved Variety.

The best part?

These Paleo friendly breakfast meals can all be made within
10 short minutes! Just as fast as whipping up bacon and eggs.

In the process, my health exploded.

Whoever said it is right. Breakfast IS the most important
meal in a Paleo day. And double that, especially when you're
following these kick butt recipes.

Talk soon, Dave

PS: You're probably asking yourself if I still have bacon
and eggs for breakfast?

Honest answer? Yeah. Once in a while. I've come to love
them again. Especially if someone makes them for me
