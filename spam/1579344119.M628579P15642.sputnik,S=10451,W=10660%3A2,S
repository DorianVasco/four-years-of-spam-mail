THESE SEEDS FROM THE SESAME PLANT HAVE A NUTTY FLAVOR. THE HUSKED ONES ARE WHITE SESAME AND THE UN-HUSKED ARE BLACK. THEY ARE WIDELY USED IN INDIAN, CHINESE, JAPANESE AND KOREAN COOKING. WITH A CRUNCHY TEXTURE AND A NUTTY TASTE, THEY ARE TO MANY DISHES FOR THE EXTRA FLAVOR. SESAME SEEDS ARE TINY FLAT OVAL SEEDS AND COME IN A VARIETY OF COLORS: WHITE, YELLOW, BLACK AND RED. SESAME SEEDS ARE THE OLDEST OILSEED AND HAVE THE HIGHEST CONTENT OF OIL THAN ANY OTHER VARIETY OF NUTS. SESAME SEEDS ARE DROUGHT TOLERANT AND ARE ABLE TO GROW MOST OTHER SEEDS ARENâ€™T ABLE TO. IT IS COMMONLY USED IN BAKERY PRODUCTS AND ONCE TOASTED, IN ICE CREAMS AND CHOCOLATES. RAW, IT IS USED AS SEASONING FOR FOOD AND TO GIVE IT A CRUNCH. THEY ARE ALSO BLENDED WITH WATER TO MAKE A SAUCE OR DIP OR USED TO MAKE BUTTER. IT MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE BATTER TO MAKE , MUFFINS AND COOKIES. IT IS USED EXTENSIVELY IN CHINESE CUISINE AND IS USUALLY SPRINKLED ON TOP OF VARIOUS DISHES AS A FLAVOR ENHANCER. THEY ARE A STORE OF 
 VARIOUS MINERALS AND VITAMINS. SESAME SEEDS ARE TO REDUCE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AND PREVENT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. IT ALSO PROTECTS THE LIVER FROM DAMAGE. ALONG WITH MANGANESE AND COPPER, THEY ARE ALSO A RICH SOURCE OF CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, PHOSPHORUS, IRON, ZINC, VITAMIN B1 AND DIETARY FIBER. IT HELPS TO REDUCE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN HUMANS. AS IN HINDI, ALMOND IS A DRIED FRUIT THAT IS VERY NUTRITIOUS. IT IS USED IN BAKING AND AS A FLAVORING AGENT IN INDIAN FOOD. ALMONDS CAN BE USED IN MANY , SUCH AS SLICED (FLAKED, SLIVERED), ALMOND BUTTER, ALMOND MILK AND ALMOND OIL. THESE CAN BE USED IN BOTH SWEET AND SAVORY DISHES. THE ALMOND THAT WE CONSUME IS A SEED FROM THE FRUIT OF A TREE THAT BELONGS TO THE PEACH FAMILY. THE ALMOND TREE ALSO BEARS BEAUTIFUL PINK AND WHITE FLOWERS. CONSUMPTION OF SOAKED ALMONDS IS A VERY COMMON PRACTICE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BROWN COATING OF ALMONDS CONTAINS CERTAIN ENZYME INHIBITORS THAT MAKE THE DRY FRUIT DIFFICULT TO DIGEST. SOAKING THEM OVER NIGHT AND PREFERABLY
  REMOVING THE BROWN COVER HELPS DIGEST IT FASTER. LTHOUGH ALMONDS ARE OF FOUR TYPES NAMELY NONPAREIL, CALIFORNIA, MISSION AND CARMEL, INDIA IMPORTS A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE CALIFORNIA ALMONDS. THEY ARE RICH IN MONOUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS THAT HELP REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART DISEASES AND LOWERS LDL CHOLESTEROL.
