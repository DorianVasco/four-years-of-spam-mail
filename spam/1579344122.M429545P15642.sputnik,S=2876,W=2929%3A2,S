Dear Subscriber,

Do you remember the last time I sent you a tip about a company worth buying in the market?

I was right on point as its shares shot up more than tenfold in under 7 days.
I had privileged information and I knew that something big was brewing.

It took me months to find the next stock that is somewhat similar to that last one I told you about,
but you can be certain that the upside potential is just as good.

Incapta Incorporated [symbol: INCT] is a company that is on the verge of being acquired by a large drone-maker competitor.

On March 28th (yes, next week) there is going to be something special announced that will take the share price from under 0.20 to over a dollar, overnight.

INCT specializes in the manufacturing of high-end specialized drones with real-world applications such as automated dispatching for news coverage by companies like CNN all the way to miniature drones which can be used to gather intelligence for the military, private investigators and police.

This cutting edge technology is changing the world as we know it, and INCT is at the forefront of it all which is why it’s being acquired and its share price is about to go ballistic.

Tell everyone you know to buy INCT right now and keep it on the low as much as possible.
