MR SESHASAYEE SAID THE BOARD DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT IT IS IN A BATTLE WITH THE COMPANY'S FOUNDERS OVER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. "I DON'T THINK IS ANY BATTLE. IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST, IS ONLY CONVERGENCE OF INTEREST," HE SAID. ON VISHAL SIKKA'S PAY HIKE, MR SESHASAYEE SAID ALIGNING COMPENSATION TO SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION WAS A CONTEMPORARY PRACTICE, THAT WHILE MR SIKKA'S COMPENSATION WAS RAISED TO $11 MILLION, THE "FIXED COMPONENT CAME DOWN FROM $5 MILLION TO $4 MILLION." ON ANOTHER CONCERN, THE CHAIRMAN SAID ONLY 8 PER CENT OF VISHAL SIKKA'S TRAVEL IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WAS ON CHARTERED JETS. INFOSYS, HE SAID, DOES NOT HAVE A CORPORATE JET. "INFOSYS HAS DONE WELL IN THE PAST TWO YEARS," SAID MR SIKKA, 49, ASSERTING THAT HE JOINED THE COMPANY "DUE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE." INFOSYS' THREE FOUNDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS MR MURTHY, KRIS GOPALAKRISHNAN AND NANDAN NILEKANI HAVE REPORTEDLY OBJECTED TO EXECUTIVE PAY IN THE COMPANY INCLUDING THE RAISE FOR MR SIKKA, WHOSE ANNUAL COMPENS
 ATION WAS RAISED BY OVER 50 PER CENT TO $11 MILLION (RS. 74 CRORE) FROM $7 MILLION (RS. 47 CRORE) LAST YEAR. THEY HAVE ALSO QUESTIONED THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR PUNITA KUMAR-SINHA, A WELL-INVESTOR AND OF JUNIOR AVIATION MINISTER JAYANT SINHA. "SHE HAS STRONG QUALIFICATIONS...A WOMAN SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY THE PROFESSION OF HER SPOUSE," MR SESHASAYEE SAID TODAY. THE CHAIRMAN STRESSED ON THE NEED TO MOVE ON FROM WHAT HE SAID WAS "NOT A ROW" BETWEEN THE FOUNDERS AND THE BOARD. "BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A GLASS HOUSE SO PLEASE DON'T STARE AT US FOR TOO LONG, LET US GET ON WITH OUR BUSINESS," HE SAID. MR SESHASAYEE ALSO SAID HE WELCOMED SUGGESTIONS AND THAT THE BOARD REGULARLY ENGAGED WITH PROMOTERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. INFOSYS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER V BALAKRISHNAN SAID THAT MR SESHASAYEE SHOULD STEP DOWN, ALLEGING THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN IMPORTANT SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD HAS BROKEN DOWN. HE DEMANDED THAT THE BOARD SHOULD BE RECONSTITUTED. REACTING TO TODAY'S PRESS CON
 FERENCE BY INFOSYS BOARD MEMBERS, ITS CFO V BALAKRISHNAN SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT 'CONCRETE ANSWERS' ON MATTERS LIKE CEO COMPENSATION AND SEVERANCE PAY TO EXECUTIVES, AND INSISTED THAT THE BOARD NEED TO TAKE THE 'FIRST STEP' TO THE CONCERNS RAISED. HE SAID THE CLARIFICATIONS BY INFOSYS WERE 'VERY DISAPPOINTING'. MR MURTHY'S OBSERVATION THAT HUGE SEVERANCE PACKAGES TO EX-EMPLOYEES RAISED SUSPICION OF "HUSH " WAS DEEPLY "DISTURBING", MR SESHASAYEE SAID.
