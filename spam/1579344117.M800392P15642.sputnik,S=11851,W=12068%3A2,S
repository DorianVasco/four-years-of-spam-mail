Hi,
A 390 pound man who was given no more than 6 months to live has stunned the medical community by losing 142 pounds in just 90 days
==>http://www.brungft.xyz/3847-864-1596-17731185/mail/tindex11.html
Anthony Turner of Lexington, Kentucky, says that the secret behind his dramatic weight loss and return to health is “all thanks to a recent scientific discovery that linked weight gain to 2 types of ‘gut bacteria’ – one that makes you fat, and one that keeps you thin.”

This shocking revelation, which has already made headline news in the Scientific American, Washington Post and USA Today, proves beyond all doubt that obesity has NOTHING to do with over-eating, and everything to do with the levels of gut bacteria you’ve had since birth.

To find out more about the weight loss discovery that has stunned the medical community, and how to kill this fat-storing gut bacteria DEAD,

SLOWLY, COFFEE TRAVELLED ACROSS THE MIDDLE-EASTERN WORLD AND EVOLVED IN VARIOUS WAYS WE HAVE IT TODA COFFEE IS SAID TO WORK WONDERS FOR ALCOHOLICS, IT IS SAID TO HAVE PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES WHICH CAN CURTAIL LIVER CIRRHOSIS. COFFEE CAN ALSO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE. A RESEARCH STUDY LED BY DUKE-NUS MEDICAL SCHOOL ASSERTED THAT ABOUT FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NON ALCOHOLIC FATTY DISEASE. PEOPLE OLDER THAN 65 YEARS OF AGE WHO HIGHER BLOOD LEVEL OF CAFFEINE WERE FOUND TO DEVELOP ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS LATER THAN THOSE WHO WERE LOW ON CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION AS PER A STUDY CONDUCTED BY RESEARCHERS IN UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND MIAMI. IN ANOTHER RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN FINLAND ON ABOUT 1400 PEOPLE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THOSE WHO CONSUME 3-5 CUPS OF COFFEE DAILY WERE 65% LESS LIKELY TO DEVELOP ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND DEMENTIA, AS TO NON-DRINKERS. A STUDY CONDUCTED AT THE MCGILL UNIVERSITY 
 IN MONTREAL INDICATES THAT COFFEE CONSUMPTION CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON’S DISEASE IN CONTROLLING THEIR MOVEMENT. THE REPORT FURTHER STATES, "THE STUDY IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING SINCE CAFFEINE SEEMS TO BLOCK A MALFUNCTIONING BRAIN SIGNAL IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND IS SO SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE," SAID MICHAEL SCHWARZSCHILD, MD, PHD, OF MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL IN BOSTON, WHO PENNED AN ACCOMPANYING EDITORIAL TO THE STUDY. IN A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT WAS REVEALED THAT DRINKING ABOUT FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE A DAY CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF SUICIDE AND DEPRESSION BY ALMOST 50 PERCENT. COFFEE ACTS AS A MILD ANTI-DEPRESSANT. IT AIDS THE PRODUCTION OF SEROTONIN, AND DOPAMINE, THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS HELP IN BRINGING DOWN TENDENCIES TOWARDS DEPRESSION AMONGST PEOPLE. IF YOU ARE STILL SKEPTICAL, YOU CAN GIVE A SHOT TO GREEN COFFEE AS AN ALTERNATIVE. GREEN COFFEE BEANS ARE THE UNROASTED SEEDS OF THE PLANT COFFEA ARABICA. IT IS TRUE THAT MANY OF THE NATURAL A
 NTIOXIDANTS PRESENT IN COFFEE BEANS ARE LOST IN THE PROCESS OF ROASTING, HAMPERING THE OVERALL BENEFITS, ONE CAN EXPECT FROM COFFEE BEANS. BUT GREEN COFFEE BEANS ARE NOT ROASTED THUS ARE ABLE TO RETAIN GREAT AMOUNT OF CHLOROGENIC ACID (CGA), WHICH MAKES THEM RICH IN STRONG ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, DR. ANJU SOOD, A NUTRITIONIST FROM BANGALORE WOULD LIKE TO CAUTION. “GREEN COFFEE, IS SURE VERY HIGH ON ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES. BUT COFFEE, BE IT REGULAR OR GREEN, CAUSES A LOT DEHYDRATION. ESSENTIAL VITAMINS AND WATER SOLUBLE MINERALS ARE ALSO FLUSHED OUT OF THE BODY BECAUSE OF THIS DEHYDRATION. WHEN NATURAL HYDRATING PROCESS OF THE BODY IS IMPEDED, IT ALSO GIVES RISE TO BLOATING. IF YOU MUST CONSUME GREEN COFFEE, IT SHOULD BE IN MODERATION.”
