BILL POLIAN S PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAMERS. POLIAN IS A HALL OF FAMER. SO HIS OPINION CARRIES WEIGHT. POLIAN, THE PLAYER PERSONNEL BOSS OF THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS, SAYS RECEIVERS TERRELL OWENS AND RANDY MOSS ARE NOT HALL OF FAMERS. "I TAKE NEITHER," POLIAN TOLD CLARK JUDGE FOR THE TALK OF FAME SPORTS NETWORK. ON OWENS: "T.O.’S SITUATION, T.O.’S TEMPERAMENT, HIS ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TEAM WAS WELL UP FRONT. HE WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. WE DID NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH PROBLEM CHILDREN." ON MOSS: "EVERY YEAR IN INDIANAPOLIS, WE SAID THE FOLLO: ‘THEOF MISSION IS 100 PERCENT EFFORT ALL THE TIME IN EVERYTHING WE DO.’ WELL, HOW CAN WE TAKE RANDY MOSS WHEN WE MAKE THAT STATEMENT? IT’S THAT SIMPLE." IF STATISTICS ARE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN HALL OF FAME ELIGIBILITY, BOTH RECEIVERS HAVE THEM: OWENS1,078 CAREER RECEPTIONS, 15,934 YARDS AND 153 TOUCHDOWNS. MOSS H 982 CATCHES FOR 15,292 YARDS AND 156 TDS. OWENS HAS BEEN PASSED OVER TWO YEARS IN A ROW. MOSS WILL BE ELIGIBLE IN 2018.
