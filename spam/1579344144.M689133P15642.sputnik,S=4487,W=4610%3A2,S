Howdy,

Do you have a survival farm that can provide an
"unlimited supply" of food post collapse? If you
look at Venezuela, with ,people eating, their pets
as a last resort, it's obvious that things there will
take years, if not over a decade to come back to
normal.



Now, if average folks are desperate enough loot
food trucks and even steal zoo animals in order,
how long would your garden or farm remain in-
tact?

Learn to camouflage it so that no one will ever
know you have a bounty of foods at your dispo-
sal:
