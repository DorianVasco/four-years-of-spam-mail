Hi ,

So, you've got poor eyesight hey...

Well, I bet you didn't know wearing glasses actually makes your eyesight WORSE, did you?

Yes it's true.

http://www.visionwithoutglasses.bid/478-70-77-19608334/mail/tindex17.html

Your eye doctor won’t tell you this

You see...in the early 20th century Dr. William Bates managed to discover the realtruth about the dangers of wearing glasses.

Here's what he had to say:

http://www.visionwithoutglasses.bid/478-70-77-19608334/mail/tindex18.html

"If glasses are worn continuously over time the poor vision will generally become worse. Essentially what glasses do is lock the eyes into their refractive state and in order to see through your lenses you have to maintain the poor vision that the lenses are designed to correct."

In other words, the LONGER you're wearing glasses (or contact lenses), the more your eyes will DETERIORATE.

Your eye doctor will no doubt tell you otherwise, but there's a good reason for that (and it's not in your best interests.)

Vision Without Glasses

http://www.visionwithoutglasses.bid/478-70-77-19608334/mail/tindex19.html

=============================================================
Stay tuned, as I go into more detail about the dodgy eyewear industry in the next email.
=============================================================

To sum it up it's all about money.

But anyway here's my point... you should at least consider other alternatives.

My advice is to look for a PROVEN NATURAL SOLUTION, as they pose zero risk and are a LOT cheaper.

http://www.visionwithoutglasses.bid/478-70-77-19608334/mail/tindex20.html

And the best one I've come across is a program called "Vision Without Glasses."

It's based on a series of eye exercises invented by Dr. Bates, and recently enhanced by Duke Peterson.

Bottom line... you'll regain perfect vision within a few months... or your money back.

http://www.visionwithoutglasses.bid/478-70-77-19608334/mail/tindex21.html

Just imagine being able to throw out your glasses, contacts and eye drops forever...

You'll finally be able to see your loved ones in complete clarity.
