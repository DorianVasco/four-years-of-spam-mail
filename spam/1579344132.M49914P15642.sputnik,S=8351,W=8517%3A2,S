			<td colspan="2" style="background-color:#ffffff"><span style="color:#fff; font-family:constantia,lucida bright,dejavu serif,georgia,serif; font-size:10px">The city is bisected geographiy and culturally by the North Canian River, which basiy divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City. The two-halves of the city were actually founded and plotted as separate cities, but soon grew together. The north side is characterized by very diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and sprawling suburbs further north. South Oklahoma City is generally more blue collar working class and significantly more industrial, having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants at the turn of the century, and is currently the center of the city&#39;s rapidly grog Latino community. Downtown Oklahoma City, which has 7,600 residents, is currently seeing an influx of new private investment and large scale public works projects, which have helped to resuscitate a central
  business district left almost deserted by the Oil Bust of the early 1980s. The centerpiece of downtown is the newly renovated Crystal Bridge and Myri Botanical Gardens, one of the few elements of the Pei Plan to be completed. In the next few years a massive new central park will link the gardens near the CBD and the new convention center to be built just south of it to the North Canian River, as part of a massive works project kn as Core to Shore; the new park is part of MAPS3, a ion of civic projects funded by a 1-cent temporary (seven-year) tax increase. Climate Main article: Climate of Oklahoma City Oklahoma City has a humid subtropical climate (K&ouml;ppen: Cfa), with frequent variations in weather daily and seasonally, except during the consistently hot and humid summer months. Prolonged and severe droughts (sometimes leing to wildfires in the vicinity) as well as very heavy rainfall leing to flash flooding and flooding occur with some regularity. Consistent ds, usually from t
 he south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly ds during the ter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and sstorms happen sporiy during the ter. </span></td>
