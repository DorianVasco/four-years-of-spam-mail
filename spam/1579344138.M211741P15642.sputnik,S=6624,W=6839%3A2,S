Hi,

If, like me, and most of us who aren't as young or as active
as we used to be you either suffer from joint pain or hope
to be one of the very few people who avoids joint pain. And
you probably have friends and loved ones who feel the same
way or are suffering themselves.

Unfortunately, we've been taught that joint pain is a
fundamental part of aging. And that dealing with joint
pain is limited to treatments:



* drugs with nasty side effects

* painful and expensive surgery that may make your
joint pain worse

* blocking out large chunks of time (and co-pays) for
courses of physical therapy

And all of which never seem to really address the cause
of the pain.

Well, I've found part of the solution to my joint pain.

This article by retired NBA player and joint pain relief
expert, Jonathan Bender.

This secret doesn't take long, but it is kinda boring.

It's practically painless, but it is kinda boring.

It is completely, absolutely safe, but it is kinda boring.

It's free and you know what I'm going to say, so I won't.

And it may sound like magic, but it's based on a great
athlete's intuitive, instinctive understanding of how your
body really works.

And every day I use this slightly boring secret, my pain
levels have dropped and my comfort increased. I don't just
feel better, my life is better.
