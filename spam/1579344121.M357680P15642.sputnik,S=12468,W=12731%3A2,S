SOME OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT SUMMER – CHILLING OUT WITH POPSICLES, SLURPING AN ICED DRINK AND DIVING INTO A SWEET, JUICY WATERMELON. WHEN I FEEL LIKE I’M MELTING INTO A PUDDLE, I TURN TO THIS REFRESHING SUMMER FRUIT. WATERMELONS ARE DELICIOUS ON THEIR OWN. I LOVE THEM IN COCKTAILS AND , BUT SOMETHING MORE COMFORTING ABOUT LETTING THE JUICE DRIP DOWN YOUR LIPS AND SPITTING THE SEEDS AS FAR AS YOU CAN. FIRST, A CONFESSION. AS A CHILD, I WOULD HESITATE TO SINK INTO A SLICE OF WATERMELON FEARING THAT IF I SWALLOWED THE SEED AN ENORMOUS FRUIT WOULD BUD INSIDE ME. I'VE BEEN SURE WHY WE WERE TOLD SO OR THIS TALL TALE CAME FROM, BUT I FELL FOR IT. OF COURSE IT WASN'T TRUE AND I GREW UP TO LOVE THE INTENSE BURST OF JUICINESS. YET, FOR MANY OF US THOSE SLIPPERY SEEDS ARE QUITE A DISTRACTION. NO SURPRISES . TAKING THE TIME TO FUSS OVER EVERY SEED (SOME OF THEM WOULD JUST REFUSE TO PART) AND HAVING TO WAIT TILL YOU PLUCK THEM ALL IS A PITY. SOME FEAR THAT THESE SEEDS MAY CONTAIN HARMFUL CHE
 MICALS AND , MUST BE AVOIDED. THIS ISN'T TRUE EITHER. IF YOU’D HOW HEALTHY THEY ARE, PERHAPS, THEY WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU. A SUPER SEED THAT YOU'RE NOT EATING AND A SECRET YOU DIDN'T . WATERMELON SEEDS SHOULDN'T BE TOSSED AWAY, THEY SHOULD BE EATEN. “WATERMELON SEEDS AND ALSO OTHERS LIKE MELON SEEDS AND FLAX SEEDS ARE RICH IN MICRO-NUTRIENTS LIKE SELENIUM, POTASSIUM, COPPER AND ZINC WHICH YOU MAY NOT DERIVE FROM YOUR DAILY DIET IN QUANTITIES. THEY CAN BE SUN-DRIED AND EATEN AS A SNACK OR CAN ALSO BE POWDERED. THEY’RE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART, BOOST IMMUNITY AND KEEP BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS IN . YOU CAN IT TO YOUR DIET AS A HEALTH SUPPLEMENT IN COMBINATION WITH OTHERS SEEDS. I’D SUGGEST ABOUT 1/2 OF A TEASPOON TWICE A WEEK,” SAYS DR. SIMRAN SAINI, DIETITIAN AT FORTIS HOSPITAL IN NEW DELHI. THESE PROTEIN-PACKED TREASURES WITH A DISTINCT NUTTY FLAVOR COULD BE THE FIRST SNACK YOU REACH FOR AT YOUR DESK, BETWEEN MEALS OR EVEN WHEN YOU’RE BORED – IF YOU GIVE THEM A CHANCE. “WATERMELON 
 SEEDS ARE ALSO A VALUABLE SOURCE OF MACRO-NUTRIENTS LIKE VITAMIN B, PROTEIN AND THE HEALTHY FATS. MOST SEEDS HAVE SIMILAR BENEFITS, SO YOU DON’T NEED TO SPEND ON BUYING PACKAGED ONES LIKE FLAX SEEDS OR CHIA SEEDS, USE SUN-DRIED WATERMELON SEEDS .
