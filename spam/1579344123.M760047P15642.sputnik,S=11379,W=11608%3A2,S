THE ONE CURIOSITY MARKET JUST HAS TO BE THE NAMKEEN MARKET AT AMER, JAIPUR. ONCE UPON A TIME, AMER WAS THE ONLY HABITATION, WHILE JAIPUR NOT EVEN BEEN PLANNED. JUST THE FORT REMAINS, ALONG WITH JAIGARH AND NAHARGARH AND THE PILE OF RUINS AT THE BASE OF THE FORT. THE NAMKEEN MARKET IS HARDLY VISIBLE TO MOST TOURISTS, BEING IN A NARROW, STEEP, SHARPLY CURVING LANE. BOTH SIDES ARE LINED WITH SHOPS SELLING IDENTICAL SAVOURY SNACKS, ALL FROM BESAN. WHAT DIFFERS IS THE THICKNESS. THE STORY GOES THAT ONE MAN STARTED SELLING NAMKEEN AND WAS SOON JOINED BY VARIOUS MEMBERS OF HIS EXTENDED FAMILY. TO EACH, HE GAVE THE EXACT RECIPE, WHICH IS WHY, TO THIS DAY, EVERY SHOP SELLS THE IDENTICAL ARRAY OF NAMKEEN, DOWN TO THE SAME SPICING AND THICKNESS. AND, WHEN YOU LINGER AT ONE SHOP, NO FRENZIED OUT FROM THE OTHERS.MARRYAM H RESHII HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUT FOOD AND LIFESTYLE FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY!

IT REVOLVES CELEBRATION OF SPRING IN THE AGRICULTURAL CALENDAR. THE DATE SIGNIFIES THE END OF ONE SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER. THE RABI CROP HAS JUST BEEN HARVESTED AND IT IS TIME FOR MANGOES TO FLOOD THE MARKET. GUDI OR ‘CHAITRA SHUKLA ’ IS CELEBRATED WITH MUCH ZEAL AND FERVOR IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA. IT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE HINDU YEAR AND THE FIRST DAY OF THE CHAITRA MONTH OF THE HINDU CALENDAR. APART FROM THE AGRARIAN SIGNIFICANCE, GUDI HAS A HINDU MYTHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE TOO.
