Want more birthdays ahead? Go outside.

That’s the conclusion of a recent study that looked at the daily habits
of more than 3,000 adults between ages 70 to 90, over a 25-year period.
Researchers divided the subjects into three groups, based on how often they
left their homes: daily, 2 to 5 times per week, and less than once per
week. When mortality was assessed in the later years of the study,
researchers found that those who went outside every day were at the small
risk of death, while those who rarely left home had the highest mortality
risk.
​
This finding was consistent even when factoring in health issues like
diabetes, heart disease, visual impairment, and impaired mobility, notes
lead study author Jeremy Jacobs, MD, from the Hadassah Hebrew University
Medical Center in Israel. “Resilient individuals remain engaged,
irrespective of their limitations,” he says, adding that the improved
survival was observed among people with low levels of activity. That means
you don’t need to go for a jog—you could even just sit outside to
experience benefits. Although the exact reasons behind the findings
weren’t included in this study, previous research has found that people
who use more time going out may have lower levels and better mental health,
which can both drive longevity.  “Throughout history, even introverted
artists and writers had daily routines that got them out of the lab or
studio,” says Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, PhD, author of Rest: Why You Get
More Done When You Work Less, which profiles several productive thinkers of
different eras. In addition to the obvious health benefits of going outside
and being less sedentary, getting some fresh air, particularly in nature,
can improve mood and emotional balance, says Pang. Also, the recent study
highlighted that people who go outside more often tend to have stronger
connections, which Pang says has been proven to guard against cognitive
decline and lower the risk of sick.

Says Pang: “Simply put, getting outside daily is essential for
maintaining good health.”

6 Surprising Sources of Calcium
Your body is constantly losing calcium--when you sweat, go to the bathroom,
when your fingernails and hair grow--and although the mineral is essential
for bone health, your body can't replace what it sheds on its own. That's
why the importance of drinking milk has been drilled into your head since
childhood.
But milk products aren't the only calcium-rich foods--good news if you're
vegan, lactose intolerant, or simply don't like dairy. To get your daily
dose (1,000 mg a day for adults under 50 or 1,200 mg  for women over 50 and
men over 70, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation), aim for
two to three servings of calcium-rich foods like these a day, suggests
Marjorie Nolan, a registered dietitian in New York City. (Search: Symptoms
of osteoporosis) Reap the biggest calcium rewards by spreading your
servings out over the course of the day: "The body can only absorb so much
calcium at one time,"says Nolan.

1. Arugula
63 mg of calcium per half cup
Choose this aromatic green over lettuce for a more calcium-rich (and
better-tasting!) salad. One cup contains just 5 calories, so piling a few
servings onto your plate is a waist-friendly way to rack up more than a
third of your recommended daily intake of calcium.
2. White beans
70 mg of calcium per half cup (cooked)
White beans pose a triple threat: They'll load you up with 10 g fiber and
10 g protein, as well as bone-boosting calcium.
3. Almonds
80 mg of calcium in 1 oz
This ticker-friendly treat contains monounsaturated fatty acids that ward
off heart disease and also bolsters your bone health with about 8 percent
of your daily calcium intake. (Just don't overdo it--a single  contains 170
calories and about 15 g fat.)
4. Broccoli (cooked)
90 mg of calcium per half cup
This bad-fighter doubles as a bone-builder, dishing up nearly 10 percent of
your daily calcium allowance in a half-cup serving. Huge doses of vitamins
C and K sweeten the deal.
5. Turnip greens (boiled)
100 mg of calcium per half cup
Don't throw away the leafy tops of turnips. They're the most nutritious
part of the root vegetable. Toss them into soups or casseroles, or sauté
them with garlic for a flavorful side dish.
6. Soybeans (boiled)
100 mg of calcium per half cup
Soybeans power up your plate with protein, as well as omega-3 fatty acids,
which help your brain function, and prevent cardiovascular disease. The 100
mg of calcium per half cup is just icing on the cake.
