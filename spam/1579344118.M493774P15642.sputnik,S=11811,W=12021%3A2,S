MARBELIZED CAKES, STAINED-GLASS PAINTED CAKES AND EVEN MONET-INSPIRED WEDDING CAKE DESIGNS ARE OH-SO VISUALLY STUNNING. THE TIP TO KEEP IN MIND WOULD BE TO STICK TO SQUARE OR ROUND SHAPES FOR ALL TIERS AND NOT OPT FOR PAINTED CAKES IN REALLY HOT WEATHER (FOR OBVIOUS REASONS). MARBLE EFFECTS ARE THE EASIEST TO ACHIEVE - ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS 'MARBELIZE' THE GOOD OLD PLAIN WHITE FONDANT WITH EDIBLE ICING COLOURS! ANOTHER CLASSIC THAT IS RETURNING WITH A BANG THIS YEAR IS LACE-INSPIRED DESIGNS ON CAKES. THINK ROMANCE, DELICATE FRENCH LACE AND EVERYTHING THAT IS FAIRYTALE.
