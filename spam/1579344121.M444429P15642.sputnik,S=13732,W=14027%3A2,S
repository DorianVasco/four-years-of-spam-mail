 THEY MAKE FOR AN INEXPENSIVE, FUN SNACK AND AT THE SAME TIME ARE HEALTHY,‚Äù SUGGESTS DR. RITIKA , NUTRITIONIST AT MAX HEALTHCARE IN NEW DELHI. WATERMELON SEED OIL IS EXTRACTED FROM COLD-PRESSING SUN DRIED SEEDS AND IS QUITE POPULAR IN WEST AFRICA IT IS OOTANGA OR KALAHARI OIL. IT IS LIKE A MIRACLE LIQUID FOR ALL YOUR HAIR AND SKIN TROUBLES. DUE TO ITS LIGHT TEXTURE AND EXCELLENT MOISTURIZING PROPERTIES, IT IS OFTEN USED IN BABY OILS. IT IS RICH IN VITAMINS, MINERALS AND ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS (EFAS). THE HIGH CONTENT OF EFAS ELIMINATES SEBUM, DIRT AND GREASE THAT BUILD UP IN THE PORES OF YOUR SKIN AND CREATE ACNE. DR. SIMRAN SAINI SUGGESTS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T ROAST THEM. MOST NUTRIENTS ARE DESTROYED ON EXPOSURE TO HEAT WHICH CAN CHANGE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THESE SEEDS. FLAX SEEDS ARE ONE OF THE FEW SEEDS THAT MAY RETAIN THEIR NUTRIENT DENSITY, FOR THE OTHERS IT IS BEST TO AVOID ROASTING. TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEM, WATERMELON SEEDS SHOULD BE SPROUTED AND SHELLED. SPROUTING IS A 
 PROCESS THE SEEDS ARE SOAKED AND GERMINATED. SPROUTED SEEDS, NUTS OR LEGUMES ARE TO BE HIGHER IN NUTRITION THAN OTHERS. SOAKING, FERMENTING AND SPROUTING ALSO BREAKS DOWN GLUTEN AND OTHER PROTEINS THAT ARE HARD TO DIGEST INTO SIMPLE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE EASILY ABSORBED BY THE BODY. ANY FOOD IN ITS FERMENTED IS MOST NUTRITIOUS. IT IS EASIER TO SPROUT WATERMELON SEEDS ALONG WITH OTHERS LIKE GREEN MUNG BEANS, SESAME SEEDS OR BLACK CHANNA RATHER THAN SPROUTING THEM INDIVIDUALLY WHICH CAN BE A BIT TRICKY.AN UNMATCHED THRILL IN BUMPING INTO SOMEONE FROM YOUR SCHOOL OR CITY IN THE MOST UNEXPECTED CORNER OF THE WORLD. IT'S ALMOST THE SAME THRILL WHEN YOU FIND AN INGREDIENT YOU HAVE GROWN UP WITH IN A COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED MILIEU OR CUISINE. IT'S WHAT I EXPERIENCED WHEN I BIT INTO A PEA AUBERGINE IN A THAI GREEN CURRY AT BENJARONG, CHENNAI'S FIRST THAI RESTAURANT MORE THAN A AGO. IT WAS ONLY MY SECOND FINE DINING THAI EXPERIENCE; MY FIRST WAS THE THAI PAVILION (AT THE VIVANTA BY TAJ - PRESIDEN
 T) IN MUMBAI. IN THAILAND, IT'S AS MAKHUEA PHUANG AND IT'S SUNDAKKAI IN TAMIL . SOLANUM TORVUM HAS BEEN EVERYTHING FROM TURKEY BERRY TO WILD EGGPLANT TO PEA AUBERGINE. THESE BERRIES LOOK LIKE GREEN PEAS - IT'S EASY TO MISTAKE THEM FOR GREEN PEAS IN CURRIES EXCEPT THAT THEY CONTAIN BROWN SEEDS THAT LEND THE BERRIES THEIR BITTER FLAVOUR.
