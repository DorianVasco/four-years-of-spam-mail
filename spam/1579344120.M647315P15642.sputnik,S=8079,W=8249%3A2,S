HOWEVER, TO REAP THE BENEFITS FROM THESE SALTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HOW TO USE THEM. A LIST OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN USE BATH SALTS. A CHEESECLOTH OR ANY POROUS OR LOOSELY WOVEN COTTON MATERIAL YOU HAVE ON HAND WOULD WORK BEST FOR YOUR OWN SALT POUCH. TAKE ABOUT A 7 INCH SQUARE OF THE CLOTH AND POUR A FEW TABLESPOONS OF BATH SALT IN THE CENTRE OF THE CLOTH, DRAW THE CORNERS OF THE CLOTH TOGETHER AND MAKE IT INTO A BAG BY TYING A PIECE OF STRING AROUND IT TO SEAL THE SALT. FILL YOUR BATHTUB WITH WARM WATER, AND DROP AND SWIRL THE BAG OF SALT INTO THE WATER TO DISSOLVE THE SALT INTO YOUR BATH WATER. THIS WAY WOULD ENSURE A BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF SALT IN THE WATER. AFTER YOUR FRESH BATH EXPERIENCE RINSE THE BAG OUT AND DRY IT. DON’T WORRY. A SIMPLE WAY TO REAP THE BENEFITS AND INDULGE IN A RELAXING BATHING EXPERIENCE WITHOUT A SALT POUCH. FILL YOUR BATHTUB HALFWAY AND JUST POUR A FEW TABLESPOONS OF SALTS INTO THE WATER. THE BATH SALTS TEND TO DISSOLVE QUICKLY WITH WAR
 M WATER, THE WARMER THE WATER, THE QUICKER THE PROCESS. SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO POUR A HANDFUL OF SALTS IN THE WATER BEFORE YOU START TO BATHE. TO MIX THE FRAGRANCE OF SALTS WITH THE STEAM HOLD SOME SALT IN YOUR HAND UNDER THE FAUCET AND LET THE SALTS FALL INTO THE WATER, THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE CALMING EFFECT ON YOUR NERVES AND MIND THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IN YOUR BATH
