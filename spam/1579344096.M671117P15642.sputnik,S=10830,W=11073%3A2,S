GOOGLE BEFORE YOU SPEAK' SHOULD BE TODAY'S 'LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP'. IN YET ANOTHER LESSON ON 'THE INTERNET FORGETS,' PEOPLE FLOODED TWITTER WITH PICTURES OF US PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WEARING A BATHROBE. FOR THE UNINITIATED, PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER RECENTLY A STATEMENT THAT CREATED A HUGE STIR ONLINE. "I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT OWNS A BATHROBE, (HE) DEFINITELY DOESN'T WEAR ONE," HE SAID. THE STATEMENT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ON AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES DETAILING THE PRESIDENT'S UNSETTLING FIRST TWO WEEKS IN OFFICE AND THE WHITE HOUSE. MR SPICER THE COMMENT WHILE POINTING OUT THAT THE ARTICLE WAS 'RIDDLED WITH INACCURACIES AND LIES.' PEOPLE, HOWEVER, FLOODED TWITTER WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF POTUS WEARING A BATHROBE. IT WAS THIS LINE IN THE ARTICLE THAT MR SPICER WAS REFERRING TO: WHEN MR. TRUMP IS NOT WATCHING TELEVISION IN HIS BATHROBE OR ON HIS REACHING OUT TO OLD CAMPAIGN HANDS AND VISERS, HE WILL SOMETIMES SET OFF TO EXPLORE THE UNFAMILIAR SURROUND
 INGS OF HIS NEW HOME. "THAT STORY WAS SO RIDDLED WITH INACCURACIES AND LIES THAT THEY OWE THE PRESIDENT AN APOLOGY FOR THE WAY THAT THING WAS WRITTEN," HE TOLD REPORTERS. "WERE LITERALLY BLATANT FACTUAL ERRORS, AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO SEE THAT KIND OF REPORTING OR SO REPORTING," HE . "THAT IS LITERALLY THE EPITOME OF FAKE NEWS," HE SAID FURTHER. YOU AREN’T GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU ARE YOU? IT IS TRUE: EVERYONE WANTS TO MOVE UP THE CORPORATE LDER. WHAT’S ALSO TRUE IS MOST PEOPLE EITHER DON’THOW TO GET OR WHAT TO DO TO GET BUT IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT PUTTING YOUR CAREER ON THE FAST TRACK, WE’VE GOT JUST COURSE FOR YOU. WHEN ORGANIZATIONS STRATEGIZE AND PLAN FOR ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO KEEP IN MIND THEIR RESOURCES AND ASSESS INTERNAL EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THEY COMPETE.IDENTIFY DIRECTIONS TO A BETTER FUTURE: FOR A BUSINESS TO BE IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL ITS EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL. STRATEGIC 
 MANAGEMENT CLEARLY DEFINES THE GOALS OF AN ORGANIZATION. IT DEFINES REALISTIC GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, WHILE ALIGNING THE SAME WITH THE VISION OF THE COMPANY.
