Home-scientist discovers easy way



to restore old batteries

His name is Tom Ericson, a home-scientist who decided it was time to stop wasting old batteries
<http://won.ryggcity.com/resxfs/slrdf20514dnngbzym/mSoj4CCv8l6ZcLidsbgIMPAYmQrjA2Ey1FjhXAXsrhU/mnpyCXOhR8ifRD1PpJUQV2lTuws2f63ZpN0cZ1-wtE4Gx8wYv1kvHnxzbrwt5-zRDcTSlWrB3wEeUNWlB4ReMogh88vrTlAounn7MtlW4Ho>.

""I'm not a rich man, and batteries aren't cheap," said Ericson when he was asked what prompted this "discovery" of his. According to Ericson, few people know how easy it can be to restore old batteries
<http://won.ryggcity.com/resxfs/slrdf20514dnngbzym/mSoj4CCv8l6ZcLidsbgIMPAYmQrjA2Ey1FjhXAXsrhU/mnpyCXOhR8ifRD1PpJUQV2lTuws2f63ZpN0cZ1-wtE4Gx8wYv1kvHnxzbrwt5-zRDcTSlWrB3wEeUNWlB4ReMogh88vrTlAounn7MtlW4Ho> if you have the tools, which can easily be purchased at local hardware stores or at websites like amazon.com and others.

The process involves just a little bit of prep work and then a handful of steps to clean and sometimes recharge the batteries a bit, all of which can easily be done at home at a far lower cost

Ericson says the only reason most people don't know about this is "because the energy companies and production companies aren't interested in getting the word out."

THE 2016 campaign was a crisis for silva conservatism; its aftermath is a crisis for jerky liberalism.

This had sewing an intuitive appeal in the Obama era, arsenic when it won the White House twice ink and seemed to promise permanent political majorities advocate in the future.
