CHINA'S MUCH-HYPED MARKET FOR VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS IS FACING A STEEP CHALLENGE FROM REMEDIES FROM GINSENG TO DEER ANTLER, EVEN AS THE SECTOR'S RISE FUELS -DOLLAR DEALS AND SHARE SURGES. THE VITAMINS MARKET IS SET TO EXPAND FIVE PERCENT A YEAR TO $20 IN 2019, HALF ITS PACE OF GROWTH SINCE 2009. IT'S BEING OUTSTRIPPED BY A MEDICINE BUSINESS THAT COULD BE WORTH $40 BY THEN - AND IS TWICE AS FAST. THAT'S PROMPTED VITAMINS FIRMS FROM DIRECT SELLER AMWAY TO GIANT U.S. DRUGMAKER PFIZER INC TO LOOK FOR INSPIRATION FROM MEDICINE RECIPES GOING BACK OF YEARS TO SUCCEED IN CHINA'S INCREASINGLY PIVOTAL HEALTHCARE MARKET. "WE'VE TRIED TO LEARN THE HERITAGE AND MARRY IT WITH MODERN LIFE SCIENCES," JIA CHEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF AMWAY'S CHINA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DIVISION, TOLD REUTERS. THE PRODUCTS FOR MEMORY AND LIVER HEALTH ON INGREDIENTS SUCH AS GINSENG AND LIQUORICE. IT RECENTLY INVESTED AROUND $13 MILLION IN A CHINESE MEDICINE RESEARCH LAB IN THE EASTERN CHINESE CITY OF WUXI. "HALF OF THE
  POPULATION STILL BELIEVE IN WAYS AND STILL GO TO DOCTORS OR HOSPITALS. THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE AND IS PASSED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION," SHE SAID. PFIZER BROKE GROUND IN JUNE ON A $95 MILLION FACILITY IN EASTERN CHINA TO EXPAND PRODUCTION OF ITS CENTRUM AND CALTRATE BRANDS. IT'S GOLDEN-HUED GIFT BOXES OF VITAMINS, PLAYING INTO THE TREND OF GIVING EXPENSIVE CHINESE MEDICINES AS PRESENTS. REMEDIES ARE USED IN CHINA TO TREAT EVERYTHING FROM LOW ENERGY TO CANCER, MAKING FOR A BUSINESS THAT'S THAN WESTERN-STYLE VITAMINS AND HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS. THE INDUSTRY'S ANCIENT ROOTS, ALONG WITH RISING DISPOSABLE INCOMES, GREATER HEALTH AWARENESS AND SUPPORTIVE GOVERNMENT POLICIES, HAVE HELPED STOKE THE MARKET FURTHER. IT'S A POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE MODEL TOO, WITH SHOPPERS WILLING TO SPLASH OUT FOR NATURAL INGREDIENTS BOILED TOGETHER TO CREATE A CURATIVE BREW. ONE SHANGHAI SHOPPER SAID SHE BOUGHT A THREE-MONTH SKIN TREATMENT FOR 6,000 YUAN ($942). OF THE MARKET FOR THESE REMEDIES, LIKE BEIJING TON
 GRENTANG CO LTD HAVE PRODUCTS WITH SNAKESKIN, DRIED , CENTIPEDE, SCORPION AND DANDELION TO TREAT SWELLING, AND OTHERS WITH OYSTER, GINSENG AND BLACK-BONE CHICKEN FOR MENSTRUAL PAINS. "AT THE MOMENT THE REAL -SPINNERS ARE DEER ANTLER AND GINSENG," SAID YU QIANGMIN, 51, A CHEMIST IN A MEDICINE STORE IN SHANGHAI.
