Hi friend,

If you're a flight simulator fan like me, you've

>>> Got to check out VirtualPilot3D now:
http://www.sixminskiny.bid/l/lt14J2251LN24EX/713RQ1581LV3823GB253WC41473916HY3494655633
I'm SUPER excited because this is arguably the
MOST REALISTIC flight sim I've ever tried.

Fact is, it may just revolutionize everything
you've thought about flight simulators

Go check out the amazing video below:
http://www.sixminskiny.bid/l/lt15Y2251YH24TJ/713FP1581SU3823KP253QJ41473916DE3494655633
Here's an overview of some features:

    200+ Aircraft and 25,000 Real Airports

    Worldwide scenery with high-def cities and landscapes

    Crazy realism and handling down to the scentific level

    Real cockpits, real controls and instrument behaviour

There're so much more stuff but I urge you to
take a look at it yourself.

I'm so stoked about this and I'm sure you're
gonna LOVE it if you enjoy airplane games.

of VirtualPilot3D...yes, not even FSX







Academics have stated that members of these groups can often show significant attachment and immersion in their activity, building strong relationships with those who they share their created "space" with. Participants can become unusually dedicated and committed to their group through the forging of their strong bonds and sense of identity, despite the construct being entirely (or nearly entirely) fictional.[9] Some of the groups are run similar to real-world airlines, and members can get a taste for being a professional pilot by joining one of the organizations.[4] Commentators have described virtual aviation as giving Flight Simulators an interest and depth that they would otherwise not have.[10] Scientific and academic study[edit] Virtual airlines have been used, both directly and indirectly, as part of research projects at universities in both aviation, modelling, and statistical theory development.[11] It has been reported that interest in this area is increasing as of 2011, du
 e mainly to advances in technology and the maturity of flight simulation as an industry.[12] Enthusiasts are often of a technical background and welcome the opportunity to work with researchers, enhancing the suitability of the medium to support research initiatives.[12]
