">Picture a bar graph that averages the best political polls. Donald Trump =
stands Pandev was born in Strumica, SR Macedonia, then still part of SFR Yu=
goslavia, and began his football career with FK Belasica, the club with whi=
ch he progressed through the youth academy.[2] He only spent one season in =
the local Prva Liga, however, before being signed by Serie A giants Interna=
zionale in the summer of 2001 when he was just 18 years old.[2] Inter loane=
d Pandev to Spezia, where he was a regular in Serie C1.[3] The following ye=
ar, he was again sent on loan, this time to newly promoted Serie A club Anc=
ona. During his time at Ancona, the team had the worst season of any club i=
n Serie A history. Lazio[edit] In January 2004, Serbian player Dejan Stanko=
vi=C4=87 was signed by Inter from Lazio and Pandev was sent to the capital =
in exchange on a co-ownership deal, for a nominal fee of =E2=82=AC500,[4] b=
ut he remained at Ancona until end of 2003=E2=80=9304 season. Pandev impres=
sed in his first year at Lazio, as he made 29 appearances, scoring three go=
als, which included a memorable effort away to Juventus where he beat Fabio=
 Cannavaro, Lilian Thuram and Gianluca Zambrotta before beating Gianluigi B=
uffon with an angled shot. In July 2005, 50 percent of his player registrat=
ion rights were transferred to Udinese in exchange for David Pizarro's tran=
sfer to the Milanese club. The following season, Delio Rossi was appointed =
manager of Lazio and Pandev began to form a deadly strike partnership with =
Tommaso Rocchi. In June 2006, Lazio bought the remaining 50 percent of his =
registration rights from Udinese for =E2=82=AC4 million. On 11 January 2009=
, Pandev scored his first hat-trick in Serie A against Reggina.[5] On 24 Ma=
rch 2009, Pandev was awarded the Medal for Service to the Country by the th=
en-President Branko Crvenkovski in acknowledgement of his sporting achievem=
ents and his contribution to developing and popularizing sport in Macedonia=
 as well as promoting the country abroad.[6] Contract dispute with Lazio[ed=
it] In the summer of 2009, a dispute between Pandev and Lazio President Cla=
udio Lotito erupted, resulting in a legal battle between Pandev and his clu=
b. The ruling was announced on 23 December 2009.[7][8][9] The dispute start=
ed with Pandev indicating his desire to leave Lazio during the summer of 20=
09. President Lotito, apparently unhappy with Pandev's decision, froze him =
out of the squad. As a result, Pandev spent the remaining four months train=
ing on his own, without making a single appearance for his club. During thi=
s period, various clubs had indicated their interest in buying Pandev, most=
 notably Zenit Saint Petersburg, who made an offer of =E2=82=AC13 million f=
or the player. Lazio President Lotito rejected the offer, demanding =E2=82=
=AC15 million instead. The deal eventually fell through after both parties =
failed to come to an agreement on price.[10] On 26 September, Pandev offici=
ally filed for a termination of his contract with Lazio, having been frozen=
 out of the squad and labelled a "rebel" by the club. Pandev argued that by=
 freezing him out of the squad, Lazio had violated the terms of their contr=
act with him. On 23 December 2009, the Lega Nazionale Professionisti ruled =
in Pandev's favor, ordering Lazio to release Pandev from his contract and p=
ay him =E2=82=AC170,000 for emotional distress. Lotito indicated his desire=
 to appeal the decision.[citation needed] Internazionale (second spell)[edi=
