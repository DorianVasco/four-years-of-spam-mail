What is WSSA?
Web Site Security Audit allows you to check for all the latest Vulnerabilities. All the time.

Securing your web site is like an arms race. WSSA will give you the necessary edge:

 * Accurate Testing
Concentrate on the vulnerabilities that are really there. We have the lowest 'false positive' rate in the industry, and we will tell you which vulnerabilities are serious ("High Risk") and which are ok to ignore for now ("Low Risk").

 * Easy access
Easy interface and intuitive results make WSSA easy to use.

 * Extensive Test Range
Our scanning engine is based on the knowledge base gathered on SecuriTeam.com - over 10,000 remote vulnerabilities (and counting!). It is the same vulnerability database used by our corporate service AVDS, updated daily for new security vulnerabilities.

This has been sent to you as a part of your WSSA membership. To stop receiving emails regarding your account and to cancel the scanning of 'scanalog.de' please log in using this link: https://wssa.beyondsecurity.com/my_account/?h=9269651a7aac , click on the "My Account" tab and choose the "Close Account" option.

Or email to support@beyondsecurity.com or write to Beyond Security at 19925 Stevens Creek Blvd. Cupertino, California 95014. Please use or include the email address which was used to sign up for the account or the web site being scanned.
