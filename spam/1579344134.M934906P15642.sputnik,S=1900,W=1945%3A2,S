Hi.

How have you been? What is your name? Where are you from?
My name is Ksenia. I actually like to chat with you. What do you think about it?

I hope that in the near future we will talk with you, how you consider?
I'll wait for your letter with impatience and expect that it will be soon.
Have a wonderful day.
