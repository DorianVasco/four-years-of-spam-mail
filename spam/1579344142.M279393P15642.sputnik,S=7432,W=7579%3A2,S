CONGRATULATIONS TO BITCOIN & ITS MEMBERS

Congratulations to every member of Bitcoin who has managed to earn their
first $10,000. Bitcoin just launched two months back and made you, me, and
all of us who partnered with their network, richer, wealthier, and more
satisfied with what we make. We all know that we are making thousands using
Bitcoins whereas the others are still having a hard 09-05 job.

But what made us different? Our belief in succeeding together and our
vision is what made us great.

Today we are happy to congratulate each and everyone of you who made their
first $10K.

Apologies to all those who could not make it due to limited seats. But the
Good News is that Bitcoin has opened 100 spots per geographical domain. If
you are from Europe, U.K or AU, positions are limited and if spots expire,
you are out of the game.

This launch is similar to what Amazon, Ebay and Google did a few years
back. People who invested at the start are now making thousands from the
comfort of their homes.
