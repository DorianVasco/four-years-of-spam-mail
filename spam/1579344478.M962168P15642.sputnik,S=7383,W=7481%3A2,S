<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">Hello,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">I got your details from an online directory and having been motivated by your personal status, I decided to approach you for a possible partnership in a multi-million dollar project in crude oil trading. The company I work for is </FONT><FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana"><B>Sonangol&nbsp; Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola</B></FONT><FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">, Liason office in Johannesburg, South Africa. We have urgent need for 2 million barrel of Crude Oil per month for 12 months (1 year) from MINPET (ANGOLA MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">As one of the Company Executive Administrators and Director, Im directly in charge of crude oil purchase in our company. Also, I have the responsibility of looking for a crude oil licensed agent with the ANGOLAN MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM (MINPET), in other to make this business possible. This is so because MINPET does not sell their product directly to end-buyers, but through their approved licensed agents who acts as their sales agent/middle man between them and their buyers.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">My proposal is this, that we (me and you) work together to get the MINPET license in your name or that of your Company, which will authorize you to be a Licensed agent for purposes getting the oil from MINPET and releasing same to my Company,</FONT><FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana"><B>Sonangol&nbsp; Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola</B></FONT><FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">.</FONT><FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">The allocation the Crude Oil to you or your company gives us the privilege to operate as the first lifter of the crude oil from the block. This attracts USD$4.00 discount per barrel to the us. The USD$4.00 is our (lifter) entitlement MINPET. Also selling to my company entitles us to USD$2.00 per barrel.</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">As we are going to be lifting 2 Million barrels per a month from the block. The USD$4.00 discount from block sums up to USD$8 Million per a month, and the USD$2.00 from </FONT><FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana"><B>Sonangol&nbsp; Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola </B></FONT><FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">comes to USD$4 Million per a month. This will make a total of USD$12 Million gross</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">earning/income to our group per a transaction per month. On equity sharing ratio, both of us will be netting a total USD$12 Million as profits monthly. These proceeds (commission) will be shared equally on equity between us at the end of every sale operational, monthly.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">I will assist you step by step in the process leading to securing the Oil license from MINPET and thereafter introduce you to our company for the signing of all the sales agreements with the (SINGAPORE REFINING COMPANY) being the end buyer.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">Once this is acceptable to you, I shall involve an Attorney who is well versed in Oil and Gas industry to assist us with the relevant documentation and give the transaction the legal backing it deserve as I do not want us to go against anylaw in any way.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">Please note:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">My intentions to profit from this operation should be kept CONFIDENTIAL between the two of us. It is against my work ethics to profit from my companys dealing with MINPET but I have seen this as a good opportunity for me to save enough money against my retirement hence my decision to source for a partner who can work with me in this regard.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#000000 face="Verdana">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<FONT color=#212121 face="Verdana">Feel free to ask for further clarifications to enable you understand this process further.</FONT></DIV>
