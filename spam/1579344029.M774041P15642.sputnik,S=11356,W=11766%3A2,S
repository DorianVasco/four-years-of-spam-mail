Hi,

Ever wondered why you seem to crash midday whilst
everyone else gets through the day with absolutely no problem?
 
It's not your fault.
  
In fact,millions of people around the world are struggling daily with fatigue, 
unwanted weight gain and more due to an undiagnosed inability to control blood sugar.

If left untreated, this can lead to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and worse.



Luckily a new, unusual and ground-breaking program has been released. 
You can now naturally and safely restore your blood sugar back to normal levels, 
no matter your age or the extent of your condition.

It's time to enjoy life as it was meant to be enjoyed.

A few references to men changing into wolves are found in Ancient Greek literature and mythology. Herodotus, in his Histories,[9] wrote that the Neuri, a tribe he places to the north-east of Scythia, were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days, and then changed back to their human shape. In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias related the story of Lycaon, who was transformed into a wolf because he had ritually murdered a child. In accounts by the Bibliotheca (3.8.1) and Ovid (Metamorphoses I.219-239), Lycaon serves human flesh to Zeus, wanting to know if he is really a god. Lycaon's transformation, therefore, is punishment for a crime, considered variously as murder, cannibalism, and impiety. Ovid also relates stories of men who roamed the woods of Arcadia in the form of wolves.[10][11]

In addition to Ovid, other Roman writers also mentioned lycanthropy. Virgil wrote of human beings transforming into wolves.[12] Pliny the Elder relates two tales of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes,[13][14] he mentions a man who hung his clothes on an ash tree and swam across an Arcadian lake, transforming him into a wolf. On the condition that he attack no human being for nine years, he would be free to swim back across the lake to resume human form. Pliny also quotes Agriopas regarding a tale of a man who was turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child, but was restored to human form 10 years later.

In the Latin work of prose, the Satyricon, written about 60 C.E. by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, one of the characters, Niceros, tells a story at a banquet about a friend who turned into a wolf (chs. 61-62). He describes the incident as follows, "When I look for my buddy I see he'd stripped and piled his clothes by the roadside... He pees in a circle round his clothes and then, just like that, turns into a wolf!... after he turned into a wolf he started howling and then ran off into the woods."[15]
