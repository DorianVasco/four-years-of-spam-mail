Over the weekend I sent you an email all about how the "healthy"foods you're eating can end up acting like a bee sting in your body. Increasing inflammation and that puffy, swollen look : Well..

About 6,000 people checked it out and we had a bunch of emails from people saying that it was the best analogy the ever heard! After all...

If you think you're eating relatively healthy but you're still bloated and can't seem to lose fat, then this probably has to do with your body being inflamed like it's gotten stung by a bee

It all makes sense in the documentary I sent out this last weekend. Which is why I'm emailing you now...

If you haven't checked it out yet, make sure you do, ok

BY YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT ANTIOXIDANTS – IN FOOD ARTICLES, FROM HEALTH EXPERTS OR ON NUTRITION LABELS. YOU’VE BEEN TOLD TO EAT FOODS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR STOMACH AND THOSE THAT PROTECT YOUR HEART BUT WHAT ABOUT REPLENISHING THE CELLS THAT MAKE UP THESE CRITICAL ORGANS IN OUR BODY? THE BUZZWORD IS ANTIOXIDANTS. LET’S BEGIN BY UNDERSTANDING SOME BASICS. ANTIOXIDANTS ARE COMPOUNDS OR SUBSTANCES THAT NATURALLY OCCUR IN CERTAIN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF FLAVANOLS IN CHOCOLATE, RESVERATROL IN RED , LYCOPENE IN TOMATOES OR BETA-CAROTENE IN CARROTS. THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANTIOXIDANTS. THEY WORK TO PROTECT THE CELLS BY DAMAGE CAUSED BY OXIDANTS. OXIDANTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE THAT YOUR BODY PRODUCES TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST BACTERIA AND VIRUSES. WHEN THEY BECOME TOO MANY IN NUMBER, THEY MAY START ATTACKING AND HARMING THE CELLS AND EVEN PUT US AT THE RISK OF SERIOUS DISEASES LIKE HEART TROUBLE AND CANCER. YOU MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER OXIDANTS FROM THE EXTER
 NAL ENVIRONMENT FROM POLLUTANTS, SMOKE OR ALCOHOL. ANTIOXIDANTS HELP THE BODY BY NEUTRALISING AND REMOVING THESE OXIDANTS FROM YOUR BLOODSTREAM. IT’S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE BETWEEN ANTIOXIDANTS AND OXIDANTS IN THE BODY FOR GOOD HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE OR OXIDANTS USUALLY OUTNUMBER THE ANTIOXIDANTS NATURALLY PRODUCED IN THE BODY. , IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF ANTIOXIDANTS FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE TO MAINTAIN THIS BALANCE. YOUR DIET IS THIS EXTERNAL SOURCE AND IT MUST BE PACKED WITH GOOD QUALITY ANTIOXIDANTS. THIS, IN TURN, PROVIDES OTHER BENEFITS LIKE DOWN THE SIGNS OF AGEING, MAKING YOUR SKIN LOOK YOUTHFUL AND LOWERING THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE. A DIET RICH IN ANTIOXIDANTS IS ALSO TO KEEP YOUR BRAIN ACTIVE AND YOUR GUT HEALTHY. NEEDLESS TO SAY, ALL THESE FACTORS HELP IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND LENGTH OF YOUR LIFE. GOOD NEWS FOR ALL CHOCOLATE LOVERS! CHOCOLATE IS ACTUALLY QUITE HEALTHY SO NO NEED TO FEEL GUILTY INDULGING IN YOUR CHOCOLATE LOVE EVERY AND 
 THEN. DARK CHOCOLATES AND COCOA PACK A BIG ANTIOXIDANT PUNCH AND ARE RICH IN FLAVANOLS AND POLYPHENOLS. A POPULAR STUDY CONDUCTED BY HARVARD EXPERTS AND PUBLISHED IN THE ONLINE JOURNAL HEART SUGGESTS THAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOUR HEART ESPECIALLY, THE ONE WITH 70% COCOA. TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE CAN, OF COURSE, TO YOU DAILY CALORIFIC INTAKE SO MODERATION IS THE KEY . ALL KINDS OF BEANS – BLACK, PINTO, RED AND KIDNEY BEANS ARE HIGH-OCTANE SOURCES OF ANTIOXIDANTS. BEANS ARE ALSO RICH IN MUSCLE-BOOSTING PROTEIN, HAVE NO CHOLESTEROL AND LITTLE FAT.
