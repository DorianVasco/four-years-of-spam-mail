Dear Dorian,

The Freenom Review Team has visited your website today. Unfortunately 
we have to say that today we cancelled your domain WALDLEBEN.TK.

The reason for the cancellation is that the website address you
used for your free domain name was not accessible or did not
follow the guidelines set in our terms and conditions.

At this stage, anyone, including yourself, is able to (re)register
the cancelled domain WALDLEBEN.TK. However, upon registration, 
an actual working website is needed to complete the registration process.

We thank you for using Freenom.

Freenom Review Team
