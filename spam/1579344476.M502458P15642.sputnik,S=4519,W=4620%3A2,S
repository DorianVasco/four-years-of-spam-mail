Hello!

I am a hacker who has access to your operating system.
I also have full access to your account.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site =
that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other=
 device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camer=
a and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 ho=
urs so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of th=
e screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails =
and contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messenger=
s that you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know =
how to do this, write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  361TXJ6oCcUARqGVjsGULD3UntfEFSqJY=
8

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will neve=
r hear me again.
I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you =
see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email ca=
nnot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the vid=
eo will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!
