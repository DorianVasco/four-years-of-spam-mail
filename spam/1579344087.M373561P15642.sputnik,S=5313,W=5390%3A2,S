<div>Dear Beloved,</div>

<div><br/>
First, I must apologies to you for using this medium to communicate to you about this project but it is of utmost importance hence time is of great essence.</div>

<div><br/>
My names are Mrs.Heneritta Phillips and I was married to Dr.Martin Phillips who worked with a major petroleum company for thirty years before he died on July 3, 2013 and we where married for 46 years without any children. He died after a brief illness and when my late husband was alive, he informed me that he had deposited the sum of (USD&#36;8.5 Million United States Dollars) with a bank to be used for charity purposes and also to start a foundation (Martin &amp; Heneritta Phillips Foundation) to help the less privilege and also donate to orphanages, refugees, research centers and widows propagating the world.</div>

<div><br/>
Why we took this decision is because we had agreed between me and my late husband that because of the terrible greediness and in fighting for wealth among his family, we should assign this project to someone without any direct links or association with the family as we did not want a situation where this money gets into the wrong hands of my husband&#39;s relatives hence the reason why we took this bold decision.</div>

<div><br/>
The sad news is that I know I would not last for long in this world due to terminal cancer hence having known my condition, I decided to donate these funds for humanity and also to assist the less privileged ones and refugees that is migrating from the Middle east to all part of Europe. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall give you the contact details of our family lawyer who would assist you claim these funds from the bank where it is currently held so that you can immediately transfer the funds to your personal account via bank telegraphic wire transfer.</div>

<div><br/>
Conclusively, I will also issue a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of the funds hence please assure me that you will act accordingly as stated herein as I hope to hear from you soonest as you can be rest assured that it will not take more than 7 working days for you to receive the funds from the date you acknowledge receipt of this mail: henrittephillips@rediffmail.com</div>

<div><br/>
Remain Blessed,</div>

<div><br/>
Mrs.Heneritta Phillips.</div>
